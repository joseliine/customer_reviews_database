I have a Keurig at home and have enjoyed it for the past 3 years. However, I purchased this machine for my daughter to take to college. My machine at home I use bottled water and other brands of K-Cups in my machine and have had no problems. I had to contact customer service immediately when setting up this machine in my daughters dorm room this week. I cannot use bottled water and I cannot use any other brand of K-Cups or pods but the Keurig brand in this machine due to it has a digital eye that reads the ink on the Keurig foil label on the K-Cups. I would have taken the machine back right then but I was 2 hours away from home and left the receipt at home. \"Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.\"  I will also be writing a letter to the company.'),

They then sent another e-mail with the paragraph about sending a new one,\" GONE \" from their e-mail. How ever I still have mine.

So, if all you need to toast is bread, go get yourself a toaster with the highest wattage that you can afford, and forget this toaster oven. I think a lot of people are disappointed with their toaster ovens because they dont do a great job of toasting bread_..Get this oven for toasting, broiling, baking other types of food, then use it to toast bread as a secondary, or fallback, duty.'),

(13, 1, 1, 4, '2015-06-12', 'Nice for rushed mornings! I am testing and reviewing this Keurig. I had never really been interested in Keurig\'s prior because I usually get locally roasted coffee beans that I use in my regular coffee maker. In testing this Keurig out I have enjoyed the simplicity of it. It is nice to just be able to pop a pod in and brew my morning coffee. The touch screen works great and I like that there is the option for different size cups and a strong brew. There are a couple things that I don\'t like so much. Since I like local coffee it would be nice if I could use the \"make-your-own-pods\", but it will only brew Keurig brand pods. The second thing is, I usually drink larger cups of coffee and it only brews up to 10oz. I understand the pods don\'t hold that much coffee but instead of brewing two pods or the same one twice it would be nice to at least still have the option to brew up to 12 oz. Overall, I have enjoyed this Keurig. It\'s nice for rushed mornings when I don\'t have time to grind coffee beans and make a pot of coffee. I also don\'t like you can\'t fit normal \"to go\" cups under it. I think I will always use my normal coffee maker most often and use the Keurig for mornings I\'m running behind.'),

So far, all I\'ve used is the toast feature but it toasts well on both sides and does so quickly.  My only problem is trying to not burn it.  My old toaster oven would take forever to toast bread.  If you do buy this model, use a lighter setting on the toast unless you like it really dark.  It\'s big enough to toast 4 slices of bread.  I like that the crumb tray slides out for cleaning.  The handles stays cool.  A great toaster oven especially for the money.  Very happy with my purchase.'),

That being said I am having problems setting the temperature so that my bread gets toasted and not burned. Either it\'s too lightly toasted or it\'s burned.

I have used the same measure of Melitta Columbian for many years and have tried Bunn and grocery store filters. The machine has been cleaned.  The pot is carefully placed.

You cannot take it off which makes it a little more difficult to clean the pot. The lid also comes open while pouring coffee allowing steam to heat up your hand.  There is also a small thermometer next to the light; what is that for?  Cosmetics?  I could understand it being there if it had a function, but I haven\'t seen one.'),
(36, 4, 1, 2, '2015-04-22', 'good feature set and almost trouble free Love/Hate.  Unit is great- operates as advertised, good feature set and almost trouble free... Almost that is, until the heater element fails and you have to deal with Cuisinart\'s customer service.  Be aware that they will certainly honor their warranty, but somewhat at your expense.  As documented elsewhere, shipping of the old unit back to them and the cost of shipping a new unit to you is on your nickel.  So, the question is, is it worth paying $40 to get a unit with known issues?  If not for the reliability and customer service issues, this would be a 5 star review.'),

The toast function works just as a regular toaster does. It fits a regular sized bagel or some thickly sliced bread. The oven portion is a bit shallow, so if your garlic bread is really thick, you will end up burning the top or not even able to close the door. I haven\'t really had too much of a problem with the oven based on my simple needs. It roasts a bunch of asparagus with no problem and in no time. Anything larger I use my gas stove.

I have to say that I rarely give 5 star ratings to any product, however this Hamilton Beach coffee maker has been excellent since I first purchased it months ago.  I am a daily coffee drinker, usually having 2-3 cups every morning, and I wanted something that not only had automatic brew setting but looked good as well as being easy to use and clean.  This Hamilton Beach looks great, especially with the stainless steel front and blue digital display.  The automatic brew is easy to setup and works flawlessly each morning, and the digital display along with option buttons on either side allow make it super user friendly.  The detachable water container in the back is a great feature too, as I don\'t have to spill water everywhere trying to funnel it into the top of a traditional maker, I just take the container to the sink, fill it with water, attach it back, and it\'s all done.  I also am happy with how easy it is to clean!  I guess the most important part is the coffee it brews, and from my experience it\'s been good, hot and flavorful.

The FIRST time I turned it on to test it, it started smoking uncontrollably inside the mechanics (not inside the oven) and started sparking and I believe almost caught fire. the smell was clearly the smell of electric parts burning. I should have known better, if a simple toaster can last more than a couple weeks, why would I spend MORE money on a product from the same manufacturer.

I purchased it for my wife to replace out old Hamilton Beach machine (which we were very happy with). After reading all the good reviews I was pretty excited to receive it. However, upon unpacking it, I discovered it\'s really very poorly made. Most of it is cheap plastic, not even well cast enough for all the lines to fit together properly. The \'stainless steel\' portion certainly doesn\'t look or feel like stainless steel, it looks and feels like plastic made to look like stainless steel. The worst part is the carafe, I think it\'s glass but it feels very light, thin and fragile and I don\'t have any confidence that it won\'t shatter with the slightest bump. The whole thing feels like it came from some low end foreign production line. On the plus side, it does see very easy to fill and clean. This is the reason I bought it as my wife has fibromyalgia and easy access and maintenance is a priority for us. So, putting my disappointment with the manufacture standards aside, I figured as long as it makes a decent cup of coffee we\'d live with it. But no matter what ratios of coffee:water we put in, it always seems to come out bitter. We\'re not coffee snobs - we just use regular pre-ground Folgers, which tasted great through the other machine. If I can figure out how to get a palatable cup out of this I\'ll come back here and edit my review. But if not, this is going back to the vendor pretty soon.'),

To make coffee, you follow a few simple steps. Fill out the removable water container from the back of the unit and fill it up with water, then replace back onto the unit. This is a great feature because you dont have to fill out a cup or bring a pot of water to the unit. It really helps to not make a mess.

You have to -- by hand -- turn the knob like precisely 1/4 inch for it to make toast. And 1/16 of an inch wrong in either direction results in either completely un-toasted bread or flames. Yes, flames. I have had toast on fire in this thing 4 times. Like completely on fire, trying to find a pair of tongs and get it to the sink.

Furthermore, each side of the bread is toasted differently than the other, with one side coming close to being burnt while the other is toasted properly, so you must adjust the settings to compensate for this, and then take the toast out and turn it and then put it back down so no side is over-toasted. The bagel setting is just about useless, as it usually burns one side.  It\'s best just to skip it and keep an eye on the bagels while they are toasting.  The best feature about this toaster is the cancel button, which lets you pop up the toast without using the levers.  I got rid of my old Black & Decker toaster, which we had for 8 years, because it had begun toasting bread the way this brand new Cuisinart does out of the box.

I have not yet used the carafe but I do love the options of multiple K-cup sizes. I have recently bought an ecofill for the 2.0 and use it in between the times that I order more K-cups. Being able to use regular grounds of my own is a nice option to also keep cost down if I am not in a position to buy k-cups. My favorite feature is the 10oz-strong option. I do like getting the most out of each cup and previously with Keurigs I have used made the cup weak if I set it to 10oz. By having the strong option, it brews at a slower rate, really getting all the flavor possible in a large mug.

At first I thought it was coffee build up but on further inspection with a flash light we could see how the plastic liner was breaking down.  Also when you touch the plastic that comes out it breaks up into small tiny pieces.  It is also filtered out into your coffee cup.  You will see small little black things in the coffee. Too bad.

I do have to out that when you remove the lid to refill the water tank, the condensation spills out onto your countertop! we\'ve learned ways to prevent this from happening just by the way we lift the lid and tap it before we fully remove it from the machine. the fact that the model we purchased didn\'t come with a caraf wasn\'t a huge deal to us since we planned on buying the insulated, stainless steel caraf that can be purchased separately. regarding what other reviewer\'s have said about the limited Kcup selection due to the new required printing on the lids, we haven\'t run into that yet. even the generic market pantry brand from target have the required printing on the top to work 100% in the new Keurig 2.0 unhindered. overall I feel this was a good purchase. it\'s faster, quieter, has the carafe capability when we\'re both ready to drink the same kind of coffee at the same time.  thanks Keurig for the free pods for this review'),

But like so many other toasters, one side of the bread is well toasted and the other is not.  In fact, this is the worst toaster I have had in that regard. However it does do bagels and crumpets quite well.  You could pay a lot more and still not do any better.

On top of that, the thing burned out after 8 months. I could probably mess around with the warranty, but I ended up buying the cheapest blender available at Costco and it is far better.

I use a straw if I want to take it on the go. I also would prefer a larger cup now that I am eating more fruits and veggies. They have one with a 32 ounce blender also, in Target, with this size, so two canisters, for 35 dollars, I may try that one next. It totally serves my purpose. I don\'t even really need another one, just browsing for a larger canister, maybe a bit more power, but realistically, I don\'t NEED another one, I can really pour some in another cup and make a second, with no need for a larger canister.

I was pleasantly surprised by what I got (have had for 3 weeks with average of 1 to 2 pots a day).

I think it looks nice. ۢ  Does not leak from pot  I even overfilled and still did not get any leakage ۢ  Reservoir is well marked for multiple water/cup levels ۢ  The coffee bin CAN be removed for filling (some of the reviews do not really make clear)  has handle for easy removal for filling (I use paper filters) ۢ  Roll feet do make it very easy to pull out  I have it in the corner under a cabinet and I only need to pull out and around a few inches to get to the reservoir ۢ  Coffee temperature is just like the other coffee makers I have been through (DeLonghi, Mr Coffee, Krup) CONS: ۢ  Does stand a little taller than most makers (it is almost an inch taller than the DeLonghi) and has a small steam vent in middle of top (so condensation is collecting a little on the bottom of my cabinet) ۢ  Digital display is BRIGHT  I can handle these normally, but this one stands out (even in a kitchen 21feet x 8feet)  I resolved by simply covering it (I use the default strength/temperature and NEVER set timer so I do not really need  used chrome tape to make front look nice) As a last point, the coffee bin has a small tab on one side (to help in removal) that was snapped off.

The water reservoir has a lift out basket with 8, 10, and 14 oz marks for water. How much you put in is how much you get out, it doesnt hold extra water. The cup rest can be moved up one notch to fit smaller cups. The power button offers \"strong\" brew and regular brew. When all is set up and the power button is pushed, it takes about 45 seconds to know it is doing anything, then is starts to make slight \'boiling\' sounds then a murring sound as the coffee starts filling the cup. The whole brewing process takes less than three minutes. My favorite part of the coffee maker is that I can use grounds, which are less expensive.

The 40 oz. reservoir ensures that you will not be making constant trips to the water cooler for refills.

Don\'t waste your money on a more expensive model After more than one expensive toaster oven going belly up within 3-4 years, we decided to just stick to inexpensive toaster ovens. This is our second Black and Decker toaster oven in about 6 years. The previous one is very similar to this model. Actually the one this one replaced still worked, just not very well (it didn\'t toast evenly, as one heat element had given out). So far, so good. We bought this one based upon the decent reviews here on Amazon and the low price. We use it 2-3 times a day, almost every day of the week. Mostly to toast bread, but also occasionally to cook or re-heat food since we don\'t like and don\'t own a microwave.'),

It\'s not a perfect toaster and was sometimes frustrating, but I could live with it.  However after about a year things went downhill fast.  The toaster became stuck on the \"Bagel\" setting (even though button wasn\'t used) so everything came out more well done on one side.  Nothing could get rid of the stuck setting.

Aside from this coffeemaker being attractive, simple to operate and consistently making a good cup of coffee. Other features that I like include:   Front access to coffee ground basket   The detachable water reservoir for easy filling and cleaning   The ability to control the units hot plate temperature   Three brew settings ... Regular, 1-4 cup and Bold   Easy to understand controls   Easy set up for an automatic brew   Wheeled base making it easy to move around the counter   A decanter that does not dribble when pouring coffee Features that I dislike: No Things to be aware of: On the top of the unit is a vent to allow steam to be released as coffee is being brewed. Be aware that that portion of the unit becomes extremely hot to the point of scalding. Therefore if the coffeemaker is placed under a low cabinet you may want to pull it out while coffee is brewing to prevent damage to the cabin Update 2/16/2015 Well in the past year this coffee maker has had to preform at least once every day and has done so without fail. However this past two weeks at about every 3rd brew it shuts down at about 8 cups of a 12 cup brew ... it looses the time and stops the brew until the time is reset and the start button is once again pushed. One year without a problem works out to about eleven cents a brew or less than one cent per cup for this $40 coffee maker. I had hoped that it would have lasted longer but all things considered I still rate it 5 star and I\'m ordering a new one as I found the first to be a good coffee maker as well as a good deal plus I like its look.

Update - I called Amazon and asked if they would refund my purchase price so that I could buy another brand, or provide me a replacement of another brand. I said I didn\'t want to go through the Cuisinart replacement program, because this item is a documented fire hazard (read other reviews), and I don\'t want another one in my home. They said they could not do this since it was outside the one month purchase window. They acknowledged they are aware it is a fire hazard but are unwilling to provide a refund.  They did say they would take this off their sell list until they could look further into the fire danger issue.

Update to this previous review...I still stand by the following information on this specific B&D oven, but I want to give a shoutout to Spectrum Brands who read this review and reached out to me to make sure I got my money back - thank you for good customer service! Too bad. In my entire married life I\'ve owned only 2 Black & Decker ovens which really did their jobs for about 13 years each!  So, of course, when the last one gave out, there was no question of what I would buy again. Right away, however, I realized this one was not living up to that standard and I was so disappointed.  Difficult to use controls don\'t allow you to find your perfect setting and leave it and worse, because of this it was prone to catch fire! I finally got the time to call Amazon to return it, but had missed their return window so I was stuck with it. Amazon suggested I contact Black & Decker, but after looking on Black & Decker\'s own sight at recent customer ratings for all of their toaster ovens, I think Black & Decker needs to do some serious customer interface and quality control work to get back the reputation their previous ovens garnered for them. I didn\'t see a product on there with a high enough rating that they could send me in place of this one and I doubt they\'d give me my money back, so right now, I\'m using one of those $5 loss-leader toasters they sell around Christmas &, ironically, it\'s much better.'),

I hate things which beep, and why should a coffee machine beep in the first place?  Like I would forget I made a pot, or that 5 minutes has passed? Fortunately, in addition to not annoying my half awake self in the morning (or those still blissfully asleep), it is also a decent machine for the money.  Brew time is not onerous at about a minute per cup, a bit longer when using \"bold\" mode. It takes about 5 minutes for the heating plate to reach full temp, so if I \"sneak\" a cup, it may not be as hot as I would like.  But if I\'m sneaking, I\'m not too concerned about temperature or full flavor in the first place (if I were, I\'d use my french press). Controls are intuitive, auto-off feature shuts down at exactly 2 hours and temp control allows you to keep things hot without cooking your coffee.  The removable water reservoir eliminates spills and the pot itself allows me to pour a cup without making a mess.  Timer seems to work as expected, although I\'ve only tested it out and haven\'t used it on a daily basis. In short, it makes a decent cup of coffee without having to think or do much. My only complaint, the LED display is a bit too bright.  I don\'t need it to serve as a clock, visable from across the kitchen.  An LCD display with minimal backlighting would have been less intrusive (another peeve - bright LEDs.  Why do manufacturers make so many appliances which beep, blink or light up a dark room?).'),

The oven also comes with great accessories as well. However, the positives stop there. The lack of functionality and the glaring hazards of this product renders it as one that\'s overdue for an update and an inconvenience in your kitchen. You immediately notice the oven\'s door - the handle\'s construction is strangely very heavy and only has a terribly weak spring to slow it down, if at all. With the added weight of the glass, opening the door is a sledge hammer-like free fall to your countertop, leaving your family to tremble in fear with every use. The buttons interface/internal program is clunky, and reminded me of the programming that goes into cheap alarm clocks. I\'d much rather have some decent knobs and simplified usability over the fancy exterior and accessory features. The oven\'s heat does not stop when you open the door, making much of the heat go directly into your kitchen and to the user. It seems dangerous and insensible to me (I later learned this is common in some other ovens too, so it may be a non-factor). Another very obvious issue for me was that the system beeps are unbearably loud and ear-piercing. At EVERY BUTTON PRESS you will be notified with an alarm clock level decibel (further drawing similarities to a cheap alarm clock). It just kind of made me laugh at how stupid it was. I was really tempted to give this product 3 stars for the overall design and materials used, but I value safety and solid operation over aesthetics. To top it off, my unit actually came with a dented top, in the top right corner. There were also some funky burning fumes that came from the initial use which gave me a headache. I had little reason not to return this product. Just a poorly executed, scarcely tested product with usage as an afterthought to good looks. It seems like an outdated machine in today\'s standards. (This experience made me scratch my head a little, and taught me to exercise caution with positive Amazon reviews - 80%+ in the positives is not free ticket to assume a smart purchase. One also has to take into account for when the reviews were written. Some aspects of this product feels like pre-2008 user experience.)'),

Any darkness setting beyond half will burn your toast or treat to a flaming crisp. The toast timer doesn\'t reset if you terminate the toasting before it has rung the bell.

The pods seem to brew a little stronger than the Keurig and the single brew filter needs slightly MORE coffee than you might usually use or it comes out weak. I use the k-cups and the pods that have the soft bottom and both work equally well.

I thought at first it was a bit expensive, but I\'ve bought this brand over the years and knew it was a good product. Well, let me tell you it is worth every cent! It makes your coffee so quickly that the first time I used it I thought I\'d forgotten the water. It also keeps your coffee really hot for your next cup!

Spent quite a bit of time going over the different coffeemakers and brands here on Amazon.  Finally came down to the Hamilton Beach 46201 and placed the order.  It arrived with the usual \"Prime Time\" speed I have come to enjoy.  The device was well packed and it was quickly unpacked and set up.  One disappointment was that it included no filters and the gold filter I ordered with the device was back-ordered.  It was going to be a few days, so we picked up some paper filters locally.  Cleaned it before use with white vinegar and then rinsed 4 times.  Finally ready for the first pot of coffee and I was not disappointed.  This coffeemaker produces great coffee in a very short amount of time.  It\'s very easy to fill by either removing the reservoir from the back or by filling the reservoir in place from the carafe.  The settings are very easy to understand and it does not require a degree in computer science to set up.  I really like the way I can control the setting of the hot plate for keeping coffee warmed.  My old coffeemaker did not have such a feature and I was always burning coffee. There are a few things I do not care for with this coffeemaker but considering the price I can live with them.  First, it has these strange little \"rollers\" on the bottom which I assume help make it easier to pivot on the counter.  If you want to move it straight toward you it feels like it\'s dragging.  Second, when the carafe is in the coffee maker you can not tell how much coffee is in the pot because the device \"body\" is black and there is no contrast.  I have to pull the carafe out slightly to see what is in it.  Last, the carafe itself.  Perhaps I\'m being too picky, but I do not like the plastic around the entire top of the carafe.  When cleaning, water gets \"caught\" when it is upside down and then flows down when turned upright again.  ( hope this makes sense )  I have yet to come up with a satisfactory way of hand cleaning it.  Even in a dishwasher one would have to be careful about water remaining in the carafe. Well, that about sums it up.  Overall I recommend this coffeemaker with a few \"demerits\".  Those 3 things I mentioned that bother me are so minor I almost did not mention them.  But, I would have wanted to know about them up front when I was looking. Hope this review helps someone.'),

I particularly like the separate water reservoir that can be detached and filled.  My only complaint is that within 2 weeks of use, while washing the filter basket, it broke.  The part allowing removal of the carafe before brewing completes broke off and won\'t go back on.  A new filter basket can be ordered but it costs more to ship than the item itself.

It\'s a generously sized four slice. The thermostat is pretty accurate. I calibrate temperature devices for a living and I\'m impressed that the oven maintains a temp within 4% (on the low side) of set point. (10 degree average) Better than my full sized oven. The dead band of the thermostat is pretty tight causing the accurate temp and short cycling the heating elements. (Good for not burning things. Bad for longevity. I\'d rather have the former. The warm up time is reasonable. (5 minutes to get close to 250, 10 to get close to 450) The toast timer works well. My morning toast was medium when set on medium. It does not toast evenly like a real toaster. Two heat rods aren\'t enough for the surface area. But my two previous toaster ovens were just as poor in this department. People have mentioned that it gets rather hot. Yeah, but no more than others I\'ve had. The back heats up more than the sides. I\'ll attach a 4\" spacer to the cord keeper to keep anyone from shoving it against the counter back splash. (Probably some bent aluminum bar stock.) All in all it\'s worth the price. A better one can probably be found but the price would be too high for this cheapskate. (Unless it fails just out of warranty.) In which case I\'ll replace it with the $250 Breville. (?sp)'),

I bought it for the convenience factor, but it has so many design flaws that it\'s not really convenient at all. I would have been better off spending a little more money for a better blender and a separate to-go cup. The blender itself is not very powerful and really hasn\'t been effective for me at all - in the course of making this morning\'s smoothie, I had to stop blending, take off the lid, stir the contents, and add more liquid multiple times. This was for a smoothie made entirely of fresh fruits and vegetables, no ice involved. Also, the blender produces a foul, burnt odor, which makes me worry that I am on the verge of burning out the motor every time I make a smoothie. As for the cup portion, it seems poorly designed and doesn\'t travel well. It is very difficult to clean under the blades, and the lid does not fully disassemble, so it\'s nearly impossible to clean the underside of the lid. There\'s a slot under the lid that I basically have to clean with a q-tip because gunk builds up there, but the lid does not disassemble. Also, the cup is too large for my car\'s standard-sized cupholders. My recommendation is to skip this blender and spend a little more money on a better blender and a separate to-go cup.'),

I discovered that the upper needle that pops a hole in the coffee pod will get clogged with coffee grounds. If you\'re handy with tools you can disassemble the upper part and clean it out. (There\'s no way to clean it without taking it apart.) Take out the 4 Phillips screws, then pop out the two plastic clips that are in the center. Use a flat screw driver to pry the clips apart. Inside you\'ll see a clear rubber tube that you should pull off the nipple. Now take out the two screws, remove the plastic nipple and you\'ll be able to clean out the metal needle.'),

When we have company (frequently), the pods are used for coffee.  I was utterly shocked to see that while this advertises 9 brew sizes, your only choices for hot water are 4 or 6 oz...Not enough for a mug of tea, and not enough to warm a bottle- my older, cheaper machine brewed up to 10 oz of hot water. I don\'t understand why you can\'t brew more hot water. I don\'t have time to brew, wait for another preheat cycle, and brew again just to get enough water. So irritated. I have wasted so much of our hard earned money on this company\'s products, only to be disappointed over and over again. I could just cry right now. Which seems overly dramatic, but not everyone has money to just toss away on sub-par products. Of course, I didn\'t realize the issue with the hot water until I had thrown all the packaging away.

Also, it doesn\'t accept all K-cups OR the refillable/reusable pod I was able to use with my previous Keurig.

Basket R&R is super easy and accessible. The removable resevoir is well designed and has yet to cause me any problems. It can be removed and replaced into the coffemaker with no drips. The unit rotates on the counter on its vertical axis on wheels under the base nicely for setup and filling. One observation though - the coffemaker is 14\" high and your kitchen cupboards are probably 18\" above the counters, and the steam from the coffemaker comes out a small vent in the top center of the unit at fairly high velocity. It is a good idea to pull it out from under the cabinets when in operation (which I do) so condensation doesn\'t wet down the underside of the cabinet. But this is inconsequential to me. Timer and settings are great, nice blue LED readout on the front, looks great on the counter. This costs a little more that some but you will not regret buying this coffeemaker.

She wanted a replacement but really liked this one before it had problems. I tried to get her to buy a normal toaster and a normal toaster oven but she wanted it all in one. I just wanted her to be happy so I wasn\'t going to fight with her on it. I did some research and I found the same model she had still for sale so I bought her a new one. It came quick enough and was delivered to her house rather than mine which is a great option that Amazon offers for free. She was very excited to get it and try it out so she opened it right away and then started using it throughout the week. I asked her how it was going and she doesn\'t like to complain so she didn\'t say very much. The next time I was at her house I asked her about it again she finally told me that it burns the toast on the lowest setting just like her old one did. She felt awful that I spent the money on it to replace her old toaster oven with the exact same one that has the same problem. She says she just has to remember to pop the toast up before it sits too long so it doesn\'t get burned. What a hassle! So I guess her toast options are \"burnt\", \"more burnt\" or, \"ashes\". The oven compartment works just fine (hence the three starts and not less) and really doesn\'t get used very often but that\'s not Hamilton Beach\'s fault, that is just my mom being set in her way. I used to love Hamilton Beach products. They were my \'go-to\' brand for small kitchen appliances but the last couple of things I have purchased from them have been huge disappointments and really just a waste of money.'),

(843, 1, 1, 3, '2016-02-19', 'Not all it\'s cracked up to be I may be one of the few users to think this coffee brewer makes only passable coffee.  We went from a french press to this because of the ability to make fresh cups one at a time, using different brands of coffee, and because it was so much easier than a french press. I mean my husband was grinding his beans every morning and that was noisy, messy and alot of effort and time, plus stirring the pot midway thru the brew. (By the way, if you decide to have a FP at some point, do yourself a favor and buy an extra glass carafe in case you break the first one.  We always kept a spare on hand so if we broke the first carafe since it is glass, all we had to to do was grab the second one and we were good to go.  Then we immediately ordered another glass carafe to have it on hand in case we broke another carafe! Sounds nuts, I know, but you will thank yourself the first time you break a carafe and can\'t have coffee that morning. And eventually we did break a carafe.)  The coffee the Keurig makes is not as full bodied as the FP and tastes more like coffee you might get at Waffle House.  We use Community Coffee pods which is made for Keurig and this is a full bodied rich coffee but you would never know that using this machine.  So that is the first con.  The next is the high cost of coffee pods no matter what kind of deals you can find versus buying a pound of coffee in a bag.  We bot the Keurig plastic pods so you can use your own coffee to save money but filling those things up defeats the ease of use we bot this pot for.  The next thing is I like to make hot tea but to make a strong enough cup of tea using my favorite English tea I use 3 times as much tea to fill a plastic pod so it becomes expensive and then I still have to make only 6 oz. on strong to get a strong cup of tea so you get even less tea using 3 times as much tea.  The next negative is you have to use bottled water which means you have to buy cases of bottled water which you then have to store somewhere, in our case, the garage and you STILL  have to clean the pot now and then for lime buildup or something that slows the flow down. Like everyone else, we now are finding we have to clean out this \"thing\" that gets clogged with grounds every few cups and you never know when it is going to quit working till you have started a pod brewing.  This is a design flaw you would not think an expensive coffee maker would have.  And lastly and this is a strange thing that I am not sure is Keurig\'s malfunction or not, but for several brews the thing just went nuts and overflowed out of my cup into the spillover below.  Normally 8 oz, was more like 6 oz in the cup but then suddenly one morning it became a full cup and a half. Every time we brewed tea or coffee this happened.  We were on our way to Walmart to buy a new one (we just didn\'t want to give up on this brand and we have two huge boxes of these pods so use up) tonite when I decided to try it one more time and this time it went back to a normal fill.  Have no idea why and no assurance it won\'t overflow again.  But if it does, then we may give our pods to our neighbor and buy something else.  I gave it 3 stars only because it is easy to use when it works and I can make a cup when I am on my way out the door with little fuss even if it isn\'t the best cup of coffee I have ever had.  There are other single cup brewers out there that let you use your own coffee  so we may investigate those even tho they may be more hassle than a pod.  This is an honest assessment of our experience with this maker.  You may not have the issues we have had, but be forewarned.'),

And I like the buttons on the top of the machine; on my old machine the buttons were on the bottom and on occasion they\'d get hit and the machine would turn on.  Only thing I would change is change the glass carafe to a thermal pot; I turn the heat off soon after I pour so the coffee doesn\'t sit on the burner for long.

I still cant figure out how to cook sweet potatoes without getting the syrup on the heating element. I started putting the sweet potatoes on rack and then halfway through the cycle running over and putting foil underneath when I hear them sizzle. *Once you get something on the heating element you will smell burnt food for sometime while using the toaster.  It will eventually fade away. *The labels came off in year 1. *slow cooking times for a small oven.  I think that the door was not shutting properly near the end though... *it looked terrible at the end.  It never really cleaned up properly.

(1030, 9, 1, 5, '2015-12-07', 'I have had one at home for quite some time and like the unit very much I recently ordered one of these for our office. Small office 4 employees. I have had one at home for quite some time and like the unit very much. It does have a heat plate to keep the coffee warm, but the coffee is self contained with very little heat escape and requires much less heating than a standard glass carafe but the burner on this unit does run at 115 F so it can burn the coffee specially when the coffee levels are low. Since the burner is direct contact with the coffee it is important to keep the burner clean. Once it starts to get a little carbon build up it will get worse much quicker. I always try to make sure the unit is turned off when the coffee levels are low which brings me to my next point. The fuel gauge - this unit uses something very similar to a fuel gauge to display how much coffee is in the unit. It is a little bit hokey. The speed at which the needle goes from full to half is much slower than from half to empty and can be a little misleading. Using an over sized coffee mug, roughly 3 cups, it takes 3 fills to go from full to half, then 1 fill from half to empty. Also when the coffee levels are low the coffee dispenses much slower. Once you know this however, it is fine. We replaced Hamilton Beach Brew Station with this Cuisinart DCC-3000 and I find it much easier to work with. On the Hamilton Beach, the container used to hold the coffee (after it is brewed) is also the same container used to fill the unit with water. You have to make sure it is thoroughly rinsed and clean between each brew. You also have to pour the water back into the unit which always results in water all over the counter. The Cuisinart has a completely separate water tank which is easily removed, filled, and returned with no water anywhere but the sink. This unit brews quickly and quietly and looks very nice. This one came with the basket filter whereas the one I have at home did not so that is a plus. It is very easy to clean between brewing and over all very simple to use.'),

She certainly isn\'t the only person in the world who makes one piece of toast.  We\'ve both had toasters in the past that was marked \"one slice\" on one slot, so you knew that if you were making one slice that was the side to use. This is one of those moment when you think this is just stupid, miscommunication and misrepresentation.  Come on, Cuisinart is a large company - you can\'t describe a toaster properly?

Then I had company stay with me over the weekend, and I did as the instructions said... wait 2 minutes before brewing a new cup. Well, it never would make another cup correctly... and I tried using both the Kcups and the basket of regular coffee. I decided to return it to the store but found the box apparently got thrown out so I am stuck it. Anyway, I have found the main problem is it does not allow the water in correctly. No water, no coffee! One morning it would not accept any water at all so while messing around trying to make it work, I powered it on, and darn if it didn\'t \"open up\" and let the water in. I immediately turned it off, and added more water to make a cup just fine. So apparently it has sensor problems! I am sure one day soon it will never work again! Another complaint is it is very noisy and will make a mess on your counter top.

I\'m fine with it (though not the waste generated from the K-cups) and I think it makes an acceptable cup of coffee for the price. Buying K-cups in bulk, even Starbucks, it\'s only 81 cents a cup.  But, we were using a 10 year old basic Black and Decker 12 cup for our entertaining purposes, something we don\'t do too often. But the last few times we used it, the coffee had a funny taste and there was a moldy smell to the coffeemaker. I knew we needed a new one. I didn\'t want to spend much, I was thinking another under-$35 coffeemaker would suffice.  But you can\'t find them with a stainless carafe, at least not easily, until you spend $50-$70.  My mother has had multiple Bunn\'s over the years and I like them. But you need to leave them plugged in and we didn\'t need that. And the cost for them was a quite a bit more than we wanted to spend. We were at the department store that begins with a K when my wife saw this Cuisnart.  It was more money than we were thinking, but it appeared to fill our need exactly. We bought it there, as we needed it for the evening. It works great and is exactly what we needed. It brewed 12 cups in about 7 minutes. The coffee tasted fine and clean-up is very easy since many of the key pieces come apart to be cleaned.  My only complaint is that I\'m concerned for the durability of the lever that you push. It seems a bit cheap and might be the first thing to go, rendering the machine useless.  Oh, and the Coffee Gauge(tm) is a novelty, but does its task approximately.  If you are a gearhead like myself, think of a car fuel gauge from the 80\'s (specifically GM). That\'s how accurate it is! So, it\'s still new, durability isn\'t a concern and it\'s worked as it should.  It fills our need for an occasional use machine without breaking the bank.

To begin with, the unit is undersized so all of the heating elements are very close to the food (too close).  What this means is that the toaster part of the oven is too narrow for bagels and tends to under toast or over toast with very little margin.  Similarly, the heating element for the oven burns things even when you are watching whatever it is you cook.  And you do have to watch what you cook because there is no timer.  The tray gets jammed easily and the door won\'t close all the way.  The tray itself is cheaply made and does not clean easily.  Also, the bottom rack that collects crumbs is inaccessible for cleaning and tends to accumulate debris because of the awkward design of the tray.  In general, the construction is flimsy and after just two months of use, the toaster lever won\'t stay down any more so you can no longer toast anything.  In every way possible, this has been a disappointing purchase - and I am sure I am leaving things out, but I hope you get the gist - that this is not something you want to be wasting any money on.'),

Never expected the Hamilton Beach coffee maker to actually replace our old one but we haven\'t used it since. This coffee maker has some great features. Choosing between 6, 8, or 10 ounce cup is simple with the integrated measuring reservoir. I think it\'s a good thing this maker does not have an internal water holding tank, using only the amount of water poured in for that particular cup being made at that moment. I believe any water holding reservoir type of brewer has the potential of mold. I refer to that type of brewing as replacement through displacement. This Hamilton Beach eliminates that possibility. It\'s fast too. By the time I get done adding creamer, sweetener, and a little evaporated milk to a freshly made cup, another cup is done brewing too. The choice of regular and bold brew is another feature we really like. Initially I thought maybe the difference between the two modes might be temperature but it turns out to be how the water is introduced into the K-cup or brewing basket with whatever your choice of ground coffee. The regular brewing mode continuously pushes the water through as with any K-cup brewer but what\'s different with bold mode is it will momentarily pause intermittently through most of the brew process. It really does make a difference too. My wife likes the regular brew mode and I like the bold mode. Wish we discovered this FlexBrew a long time ago.'),

I used a K cup for my first cup. I filled the cup with water that I would be drinking my coffee from and poured the water from the cup into the reservoir. They ask that you do this so you do not overfill the reservoir. I would have preferred to have a reservoir on the side of the machine to fill with water and then select the size of the cup to fill from the machine. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew makes a humming noise while it is brewing and a blue light is on for the entirety of the brewing cycle, which is not long. The coffee maker shuts off automatically when the brewing cycle is complete. When the lid is closed to brew a large hole is made in the K cup top by a pin in the lid and there is also a stab hole made at the bottom side of the K cup, which is made by a sharp blade in the cup dispenser where the K cup fits in.

However, we seriously doubt the quality controls at Hamilton Beach and more so, we detest their lack of customer centric support. The first one died within 6 months. First the timer stopped working. Then the power button stopped working. We didn\'t check the warranty and figured it was just bad luck and we went out and bought another via Amazon. 3 months later this one died. It simply wouldn\'t switch on anymore. This time we checked the warranty and figured we could call them to get a new one. Here is the trick with that: they make it really hard to get a new one. Kinda like insurance companies putting in fine print to ensure there is no payout. That, by itself, should be a deterrent for buying. They make you try and read the melted/ stamped bottom and that is sheer impossible. I could not read it to the rep and even sent a 13mp photo to them to read for themselves which they couldn\'t. When I finally offered to hold a current news paper next to it with a sign reading\" it\'s really me\" the rep gave in and asked me to take photo\'s of the plug cut from the cord and email it to them. HOWEVER, BEFORE THEY DID THAT THEY ASKED ME TO PAY 11$. That is where they go dirty: regardless of whether they send the item they keep the 11$. So if they then come back and say your photos are rejected, you are still SOL and need to file a creditcard claim which they will win due to the fine print stating you are paying them 11$ for the sheer awesomeness of getting their support on the phone. Anyhow, fast forward 2 weeks: no response anymore to any of the emails with the case number and the photos. They simply went on mute. Absolutely ridiculous, Hamilton Beeatch. Ipso Facto So here is what I recommend: it\'s a good coffee maker when it works but myluck was suspiciously short lived x 2. And when you need their client service, despite warranty, they will make it heart attack level tough to get that replacement. So DO NOT buy this online, but rather in a store that offers the 10 or 15$ 2 year no questions replacement. You will get the value out of that as this thing is possibly going to fail and you can avoid dealing with HB-BS. Good luck. We moved on to a Presto 02811 and due to its simplicity we love that, HB lost a customer and we don\'t care. Hope we warned you sufficiently as companies that treat customers like suspects in a line up and then hit the ignore button deserve no ones\' business. PS: yeah, I do dislike them this much, given their utter lack of customer care let alone service. It should be called the HB Customers we-don\'t-care plan.'),

All I can say is \"buyer beware\".  I\'ve never experienced a coffee maker to make horrible tasting coffee before and I want to warn others before they try it themselves.  I have ditched it and bought a new one since then and was very relieved to have a \'normal\' tasting cup of coffee after I did so.  Sorry, I\'m just being honest.'),

Anyway, this machine is about as user-friendly as it gets. The removable reservoir is great, but I prefer to pour the water into it from the carafe which is also easy and does not get water all over my counter like the Mr. XXXXX did.

You have the option to use ground coffee but that option doesn\'t work. Every time I use that the coffee spills everywhere. One time I even used a K Cup and all the stupid thing did was make noise and spill the coffee. It does work okay most of the time but for every 10th time used it acts up. I use a real, true, Keurig at work and its better all the way around. Its easier to use, makes the coffee better, and doesn\'t spill at all. So to sum it up just avoid this coffee maker.

However, today i opened up the top after brewing and saw that there was a big clump of dry grounds above all the moistened grounds. This means that a significant portion of the grounds aren\'t even being used when it brews. No wonder its so weak. Boo. Maybe I\'ll try pour-over next.'),

I honestly was able to start (measure/add water, scoop/add coffee) an entire 12 cup pot of coffee in my old traditional brewer in the time it took for this to brew. It also is messy and tends to always drip a decent amount of coffee even after you think it is done. I returned this and just got a Keurig. The Keurig at least has a much better and larger water reservoir and it will get your coffee brewed in about 1 minute. This just wasnt worth the money saved in my opinion.

Our main use was for toasting bread, and one reason why we bought the oven was because the advertisement read consistent toasting every time.  Well, it was not consistent, and have since noticed that they advertise of the packaging that you will get a consistent toast (or bake).  So, between the short life time for a toaster that should last 10 years, and the inconsistency in it\'s toasting ability, it gets a one star.

I agree with other users, the product works very well.  It has a nice big reservoir to hold water for about 4-5 cups of coffee. You can use the carafe and larger mugs with this version. Like others, I don\'t like that you have to use Kuerig cups that are marked on the rim.  If you buy coffee that does not have the Kuerig markings on the top rim of the pod then it will not work.  Like others have found, this can be worked around by taping an old rim onto the pod.  I understand Kuerig is trying to control the consistency of the coffee used in their makers but this is a real hassle.  It seems a cheap way for them to get licensing fees or whatever.'),
(1455, 5, 1, 5, '2014-02-05', 'First Impression Review I have finally found a coffee maker that makes coffee the way I like it and brings back memories of my favorite coffee maker, the Braun KF180 FlavorSelect. Braun decided not to make the coffee maker that I would still be using, today,  but Hamilton Beach has created a suitable replacement that may even go the KF180 one better in a few of the convenience areas. I make my coffee in an open area on a peninsula, so I don\'t really need the removable water reservoir... I just bring my pitcher of filtered water to the dance, direct from it\'s location. The brew strength selector is SO much easier than my last $90 coffee maker that required all sorts of soft menus on a tiny and very dim screen... pressing the mode button six times and so on. Never could keep that one straight, so I never cried when it recently failed about a year or so after purchase. This carafe pour spout has so far not dribbled a drop of coffee down the side of the carafe or on my counter top, like the $90 model did in abundance. Finally, a clean coffee area... well, relatively clean. Even before I tried both normal size brew strength settings I could tell that the bold setting was selected to bring out the flavor of my Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee. The \"keep warm\" setting is likewise very easy to adjust, with stupid proof graphic interface to show you the settings. The clock in the digital screen is as easy to set as the one in my 2000 model pickup truck (hour and minute buttons), and it can be seen very easily when I first enter the kitchen in bright blue numbers. I don\'t really need a clock on my coffee pot, but I just hate seeing a flashing 1200, or the wrong time on a clock. On this machine, this task is easy. The bottom of the coffee maker has a base that easily rotates on my counter, to make adding water very easy from the side of the reservoir. The basket style coffee filter holder is easy to remove and take to a location so I can pour the ground coffee from the grinder catch container and avoid the potential of grounds going places I don\'t want them, in the maker itself. The first pot I brewed, I immediately dropped a thermometer in the drip hole and pulled it out...  when it went just past 180, after the brewing was done... that is my favorite carafe temp, which is very different from the temperature of extraction for those who consider 200 degrees in the carafe as perfection. That means at least some of the water was most likely past the boiling  point when it hit the grounds. That removes some of the more volatile flavor notes that I have come to appreciate. I don\'t pay for EY coffee beans just to ruin the flavor during brewing. The carafe is easily moved to and from it\'s perch in the machine, even when filled with coffee, which was not the case with my now expired $90 coffee maker. Finally summing up... this little $45 beauty ranks right beside my previous and more expensive favorite, but now extinct coffee maker, and well above the next in line. If this one lasts a decent amount of time and isn\'t replaced by Hamilton Beach with a piece of junk, it could be my favorite of all time. I called this a first impression review, so if longevity becomes a problem, I will be back to set that record straight, if I can overcome the depression of my loss long enough to post again. Coffee makers are very personal, and important to people who love their coffee. That\'s me.'),

The toaster function automatically pops the toast after a set time, but the oven just stays on until user turns it off. That seems really dangerous if you ask me. What they should do is have the toaster knob function as dual duty and serve as a timer during oven operation. I assumed that was how it worked until I found out otherwise. 2. The oven compartment is really, really small, smaller than it appears in the photo. I\'d be mostly using it for mini-pizzas which would just barely fit, my bigger concern being that the top of the food would get overdone since the top burner is so close to the food and there is no way to set the oven to just use the lower burners.

I haven\'t purchased a carafe yet but it might be something I consider in the future for when I have company. My biggest complaint is that you cannot use third part \"k-cups\" and my favorite coffee happens to be from a non-keurig brand.

You can also make either a regular cup of coffee by raising the base up, or you can make a travel-mug sized drink by lowering it back down. There\'s no chance of overflows because you use the cup to measure the water in. It\'s so simple: decide on the size and type of drink you are going to make, pour in the water, insert either the pod or measure in the coffee, close the top, press the start button, and in about a minute you have hot coffee, tea, cocoa, or any of the wide range of drinks you can make with the pods.

(1593, 1, 1, 5, '2015-06-07', 'Great Upgraded Brewer I was very happy to get this Keurig (K250) as I wanted a replacement for another coffeemaker. I have a Keurig mini that works well, but this brewer is a definite upgrade from that. Unlike my mini version, you don\'t have to refill the water after each cup. This brewer has a large water reservoir that will last me all day long. It\'s extremely easy to use. Just fill the water in the reservoir and wait a couple of minutes for the water to preheat. Then, add your choice of K-cup, select the number of ounces from the touch screen then press the brew button. Unlike the mini version, as soon as you press the brew button, the coffee is instantly brewed in about 15 seconds. It\'s quick and easy to use and a definite upgrade from the mini version. The only drawback, however, is that not all of my k-cups were functional in this new brewer. So, if you have an older mini version or another Keurig, I would suggest keeping it as a backup brewer just in case not all of the k-cups are functional. Also, it would have been nice to have had a carafe, but it is not included with this particular model. Overall, this brewer is really fast and easy to use. It\'s sleek and functional and doesn\'t take up a lot of counter space. It\'s definitely recommended as an upgrade or a replacement brewer.'),

I have not contacted Keurig support about this, yet. The Keurig makes coffee that is about 60-70% as good as my pourover coffee with fresh, locally roasted beans. The convenience sometimes outweighs the hassle of heating up the kettle, grinding beans, etc. If I have the time, I\'ll always choose a pourover. This is nice to have, though. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.'),

I came to find a replacement water reservoir for the one I dropped (Amazon doesn\'t have one). With that out of the way...I have owned this maker for 13 months and we\'re very happy with it. Happy enough that rather than go out and find something new, I\'m willing to spend the $30 to replace the water reservoir I broke. There are some drawbacks/wishes, but they\'re very minimal and not enough to keep me from liking this machine enough to write a review. On the plus side: 1) In addition to making a very good cup of coffee, it\'s a lot of fun! When we\'re done having coffee we make a pot of hot water to keep for hot chocolate and other instant drinks, snacks, oatmeal, etc. 2) You have the option of making as much or as little as you like. 3) I can use paper filters so I don\'t have to deal with messy grounds. 4) It accommodates both tall and wide cups/bowls. 5) I originally thought the light on the dispenser and the gauge were a little gimmicky until I found how useful they really are. The gauge is not accurate but gives you a pretty good idea of what\'s left in the reservoir. 6) If your diligent, it\'s easy to clean (found that out the hard way). 7) Programmable...what\'s not to like about coffee being ready when you are? 8) Programmable Auto Shut-off up to 4 hours. 9) Fast. I haven\'t timed it but I never find myself standing in front of it wishing it would hurry! Now for the drawbacks/wishes: 1) I wish there was a separate power button for the hot plate. If you want to keep things hot for more than 4 hours you can only start another brew cycle. At the end of the day, this is a coffee maker and you should not keep coffee for 4 hours. That just tastes bad. But as I mentioned above we make hot water too and I worry that if I don\'t add water to the reservoir I may damage the machine. My issue, not the machines. 2) You will need some sort of rolling tray under it. While the machine will fit under a cabinet, there isn\'t enough space to open the lid and access the coffee basket and coffee reservoir. Not a big deal. From what I can tell most coffee makers are like that. 3) Even if you have the clearance, a tray of some sort is needed, especially if it\'s placed on a wooden counter. The drip tray is also designed to catch any liquid that gets under the coffee reservoir. It catches most but not all. Condensation forms on the lid and when you open it, that water slips right down between the machine and the reservoir. It really is minimal. I just keep mine on a plastic tray, wipe out any liquid I see when I remove the coffee reservoir (be careful if the hot plate is still hot) and occasionally have some dribbles to wipe up under the drip tray. 4) Ease of cleaning. This was a big problem but now is under control. Cuisinart says you can put the coffee reservoir in the top rack of a dishwasher. I can\'t speak to that. I have never tried to use the dishwasher. I use it too often through the day and run my dishwasher only when full. I made my coffee in the morning and then in the evening, when I was getting it ready for the next day, I hand washed all the parts in hot soapy water and even used a bottle brush. About 3 months ago we came up with the hot water idea and I noticed there were brown flecks floating in it. I realized these flecks were coffee residue and if it\'s floating in my water, it\'s floating in my coffee too!. I went crazy trying to clean this thing. But there are so many nooks and crannies inside the coffee reservoir that cannot be reached, even with a toothbrush. I thought about trying Dip-it (a fabulous percolator cleaner) but was afraid it might damage the plastic of the machine. Recognizing the machine was already no good if I couldn\'t properly clean it, I did a little Dip-it research and decided to try their soaking method. All I can say is EWWW! It looked like I brewed a pot of coffee but it worked like a dream and we haven\'t had a problem since! Now I\'m just very careful to wash the coffee reservoir IMMEDIATELY after I pour my last cup. I make sure the coffee doesn\'t get a chance to dry inside and I wash it the same way...really hot soapy water and a bottle brush. 3 months, Fleck-free! All and all one of the best little home coffee makers out there (IMHO). I see other reviewers had problems at the 2 year mark. Maybe I\'ll check in again when I hit it! Hope this helps.

First, the carafe has plastic around the top edge ... I assume this is to help it not chip or break, which is GOOD, however there is always a little bit of coffee (or water when washing out) that gets stuck in the edge - see photo. Another thing that irks me just a little is the display is SUPER BRIGHT ... which might be really nice for some folks but I would prefer a dimming option. And one final thing - the water reservoir is kind of hard to see through when looking straight on. Now, that could just be the lighting in my house, I don\'t know. BUT I figured out a way around this: I just look inside the tank while filling and can see the marks on the other side, through the tank. I\'m not sure if that makes sense or not?! Again, these are minor things. We\'ve been using this coffee maker at least once a day for a few months now (ever since we got it) and like it a lot. I would recommend it to others.'),

The only problem I\'ve had with mine is it sometimes leaks - not because I fill it too much, it just does leak, but only a small amount of water and not all the time.  I looked at several different makes and models and choose this one and am glad I did.  I like it much better than a coffee maker with a cafe/pot, which is what I previously owned. You can make 10-12 cups or up to 4 cups depending on the setting you use. It is easily programmed to automatically make coffee and then shut off at set times. The shower head distributes the water in over the coffee grounds in the basket/filter - you can use filters or the permanent gold basket,  but not both at the same time - so I think you get a richer coffee flavor. Overall it\'s a good product and I highly recommend it.'),

We have not had the leaking in the water fill issue that some have mentioned. I suspect it was not seated correctly. Maybe it wears after time. I just leave it in there. The fill is much more accessible than many I have seen. It is nice that you can remove it for cleaning. Some have mentioned the coffee is not kept hot enough. The hottest setting is fine for me. It is said too hot coffee hides the flavor. I think that is why some chains serve the coffee so hot. Then you can\'t tell it tastes bad. The one time I tried the bold brew setting I found the coffee weak. However I was using a coffee brand I don\'t normally use so I will update this later. All and all it is a good machine and would recommend it. We bought this because our Cuisinart coffee tea combo maker that we have had for several years started leaking water from the coffee fill into the tea fill thus crating stagnant water,'),
(1748, 5, 1, 5, '2016-08-11', 'Best bang for the bucks. This coffee maker was purchased after a thorough review of reviews. It replaced a short line of other drip coffee makers which had all died after various years of service. I am a bit of a coffee nut, in that I purchase and grid my own beans and have a fair sense of what a good cup of coffee tastes like. This device, in my opinion, is the absolute best combination of features and pricing that you are apt to find.anywhere. The first maker that I received had its electronics die on the second pot that I made. This is not unusual; electronics either die immediately or they last forever. So I sent it back and in two days had another. (Great customer service, by the way!) Now to the coffee maker itself: The pot is great! No drip or spills when you pour from it. The reservoir is truly handy and easy to fill. Unlike many others which require you to pour a pot of water into them, this one lifts off for filling and has clearly marked volume lines. The filter basket is very easy to access as it swings out when you depress a release button and has is easily removed for cleaning. The electronics are easily programed for an automatic start at a future time and the manual start is as simple as pushing a button.  It has a pleasing appearance and is not particularly loud when it is running. This unit has an option to increase brewing time so that the coffee produced is changed from \"regular\" to \"bold\". It also has an adjustable \"keep warm\" feature which allows the brewed coffee to be held at any of three temps. You can also just turn it off if desired. In short, this is not the cheapest coffee maker you can find, but it is probably the best combination of features that you can find on a coffee maker and at a very good price level.'),

Two months ago, I was even considering buying the same model for a second home, this time through Amazon (didn\'t even think of looking at the reviews, since I\'d already had mine a few years.)  However, about a month ago I noticed a slight sagging in one of the heating elements of the one unit I own.  When cool, the sag was barely noticeable. Tonight, while making some toast, I noticed the heating element actually sagging so low the crumb tray was actually turning black and the heating element seemed to be sparking.  Needless to say, I disconnected the unit.  (I feel I dodged a bullet, by having the sparking happen while I used it - my kids wouldn\'t have given it a second thought.).  I went on-line to see what could be causing this.  I cannot believe how often heating element problems seem to be coming up with this unit.

While Keurig claims it does this so you get the best coffee experience, shouldn\'t I be able to choose any coffee I like whether they sanction it or not?  It is also noisier and slower than the previous Keurig.  Sorry, Keurig, but you lost a customer.  I will most likely return it and buy a different brand.'),

The pan itself does not have a non stick surface so anything that burns onto the pan is pretty much impossible to get off unless you use a knife. That, of course, scratches the surface.

After my experience with Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler, however, I\'ve totally changed my mind about anything Cuisinart! I have had excellent results from my toaster oven at home and wanted to replicate that experience at our vacation home.  I did a thorough investigation of all toaster ovens small enough to store in our vacation home kitchen cabinet.  Aside from not hot having a timer, this Cuisinart toaster oven with its 1800 watts seemed to meet our criteria. There are two slots in which to insert the oven rack.  If the rack is inserted in the higher of the two slots, it automatically comes out -- as advertised -- when the door is opened.  If does not, however, automatically come out when inserted in the lower slot. There are three recommended Rack Positions.  Position A, for baking pizzas, cake, chicken or muffins, is when the rack is inserted down in the lower slot.  Position B, for broiling or baking nachos or potatoes, is when the rack is inserted up in the lower slot.  Position C, for toast, bagels and open-faced sandwiches, is when the rack is inserted down in the upper slot. I\'ve only used this toaster oven a handful of times because I\'m afraid it will cause a fire!  I was excited when it first arrived and immediately began to prepare my husband\'s favorite salmon dish that very evening.  After reading all the directions, I proceeded to bake the salmon filet @ 450 for 5 minutes.  Smoke billowed forth from the top vents and oven door within minutes, causing me to immediately turn it off and pull out the plug.  I then had to turn on my regular oven, wait till it preheated to the correct temperature and finish cooking the salmon.  Since I wanted to give it a fair trial, I turned on the nearby vent from my microwave/stove unit prior to trying it again at a slightly lower temperature. Sadly, the result was the same. Not wanting to give up, I tried a number of cakes, cornbread, muffins and biscuits.  I\'ve come to the conclusion that Position A is too close to the bottom heating element, thus heating the bottom of baked good irregularly.  Position C is too close to the top heating element with equally disappointing results. I found six reports on www.saferproducts.gov concerning the defective heating elements.  It is dangerous and should be recalled. The temperature always seems higher than what is set on the temperature dial as proven by the irregular/darkened outside of most everything I\'ve made The outside of the toaster oven gets excessively hot whenever it is turned on. The dials are difficult to read. Lastly, I find it telling that the Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler lists for $145 but reduced to $69.01 when I bought it from Amazon last March, 2014 and now even lower.'),

That was on December 18 and we still have not received the replacement like they said. They were quite rude about the fact that we bought it on Amazon, so I am not sure if that is why they haven\'t done anything. We are still trying to get it replaced, we should have gone through Amazon, but figured it came under the manufacturers warranty, which it should have.

UPDATE: The toaster doesn\'t work right - you have to flip the bread over - top to bottom - to get an even toastiness. Also, there is no tray on the bottom. The height of the oven is so small I can\'t even bake a regular size baked potato. If you are not careful, the item (s) in the oven will slip behind the grate and, if you have preheated the unit, you have to let it cool to reach back there and retrieve it. The cord is very short (and so am I) so I have to stretch to reach it when it\'s plugged in. Lastly, - and this might not be true for everyone, but when I set it to any temperature above 300 it pops the breaker on that side of the boat (yes, I live on a house boat). It uses more electricity (watts) then the breaker can handle. So...I really wish I had had more of a chance to use it sooner (as I got it as a gift and it sat in the box for two weeks) . It is now no longer eligible for a return. I really wish I had ordered the newer model and spent the few extra bucks since the new one is 10\' taller and somewhat deeper and comes with a tray.

Upon further inspection, I saw that the blade wasn\'t even turning. Great. I pressed the button a little longer, hoping for a miracle, only to see the item start smoking. That was not so great. After some tears (from frustration and hunger) and a couple emails, I arranged to send the faulty product back to the manufacturer in exchange for a working one. After waiting another two weeks, the new product arrived; and this time, started blending right away. I spent two glorious months with this little guy. We went everywhere together: to class, grocery shopping, even to the doctor\'s office. However, after a mere five uses, things started going south. Slowly but surely, he stopped blending. I would find entire chunks of fruit in my smoothie; but still, I persevered. After seven or eight uses, he started screaming. I do not know how else to describe the sound that this blender made with any word from the English language other than \"screaming\".  My dog howled in despair and my roommate ran into the kitchen, asking who was being murdered. But still, I persevered. On the tenth use, while I watched my fruit stir sluggishly in the blender and heard the scream of the motor, I started to smell smoke. Soon after, I saw the smoke. There was so much smoke, you guys. I quickly lifted it out of its pod to run it under cold water. As I did so, it started falling apart in my hands. I watched pieces fall on the floor as I cried; the blender crumbling like my heart.

My only complaint is that like other people pointed out, this toaster oven tends to burn toasts, but there\'s a fix for that. I found that toasting for 2 minutes gives me a good, lightly brown toast. It took me  a while to figure out, and until I did, I ate many a blackened toast. In all, it\'s a good buy for people with small kitchens and people with small families.'),

That\'s the only answer that makes sense for how bad this coffee is.  If you make 3 or 4 pots consecutively, the 4th pot might not be as bad as the first.

I didn\'t exactly get what was meant by having a separate tank for filling but I tried it anyway.

It is easy to use and comes in handy if you don\'t want to throw the last cup out but want your coffee ready to go in the morning. It took me a bit to get used to but now I love that feature. My husband works 2nd shift and sometimes likes to finish the pot when he gets home. I especially like the LED display, as well.  It is bright and easy to read.

(1956, 1, 1, 3, '2015-06-09', 'Just an OK brewer I don\'t drink a ton of coffee but what I do drink is almost exclusively Dunkin K-Cups. I was pleased to see they had already upgraded their K-Cups to work on the 2.0 machines so the ones I already had would work in this machine. This machine brews up to a 10oz cup and has a strong setting that you can select. It will also dispense hot water in up to 6oz doses. You can also purchase an optional carafe and use carafe K-Cups to brew up to 4 cups of coffee. In the box they also give you a needle maintenance tool, descaling solution, a couple of water filters, and 4 sample cups. After using the machine for a couple of weeks it seems to work mostly as expected. After using the machine for a day I figured out that you have to hold your finger on the power button to actually turn the machine off. It doesn\'t seem to have an auto-off like my old brewer. I don\'t like this very much. It is kind of hard to believe that there is no auto-off function anymore. I don\'t like the tank on the back very much. It is an awkward shape to hold while filling and carrying around with water in it.  Also it is awkward when you are trying to place it on the back of the machine while it is sitting on a counter top with cabinets over it. It is very easy to accidentally spill while doing these activities. Overall the machine works but I wouldn\'t say it is outstanding.'),
(1957, 3, 1, 5, '2014-08-21', 'Convenient for many purposes I haven\'t owned a toaster oven before, and I bought this one based on features, price, and good reviews. It\'s quite a bit larger than the four-slice toaster that it replaced, so I had to rearrange the kitchen counter a bit. The toaster oven is about 19\" wide, but I leave about 3\" clearance on each side, so it takes up about 25\" of running counter space. On my counter, it plugs in directly behind the unit, so it winds up being about 15\" deep, to leave about 4\" clearance from the wall, so the toaster oven metalwork doesn\'t press against the plug in the electric outlet. I have about 8\" clearance above the unit to the overhead wooden cabinets, which seems very comfortable. I measure the electric cord to be about 24\" long; it comes out of the back of the right side of the unit, looking from the front. As others have observed, the entire outer surface of the unit gets hot with use. The only safe things to touch during use are the door handle and the control push buttons. If you don\'t touch anything else with your bare fingers, you will be fine. The only things I store on top of the unit are the metal pan/tray/rack that go in the unit, I wouldn\'t store anything else on top due to the heat. I think the controls are a little complicated, but by going slowly and thinking about what I\'m doing, I can usually manage to press the correct buttons in the correct order. Basically what you do is press a mode button (like Bake), then the up/down buttons to change the temperature setting (if desired) which is flashing on the display, then the Timer button (time now flashes on the display) followed by up/down to change the time duration (if desired), followed by the Start/Stop button. Once a Bake operation starts, you can press the Convection button to start the internal fan. It\'s no big deal if I make a mistake or forget what I was doing, because it\'s easy enough to wait a few seconds for the control panel to time out, then re-enter the correct sequence from the beginning. It\'s a little annoying trying to change the temp/time numbers because they flash on and off slowly, so you only see the value half of the time. I have noticed that some frozen foods say not to cook them in a toaster oven, which confused me. After researching the issue, I discovered that the reason is that a toaster oven is small and not very powerful, compared to a full-size oven. Therefore when you cook a significant amount of frozen food in a toaster oven, the food may cook unevenly and perhaps incompletely. For pre-cooked frozen food that you merely have to heat up, that\'s not such a problem. But other frozen food starts out raw and must be cooked thoroughly, and incomplete cooking can cause food-borne illness. One way to minimize the problem is to use a cooking tray without a rim, such as a small baking sheet or even just the wire rack, and then turn on the convection fan to distribute the heat better. Trays that have a lip or rim, especially a substantial one, can interfere with air circulation and heat distribution, so items near the rim can be undercooked. Another way to avoid the problem is to put the frozen food in right away after you start the oven, before the oven has preheated. Normally what you do for a Bake cycle is wait for the oven to beep once, indicating it has preheated to the desired temperature, then you put your frozen food in. Once the oven beeps at preheat, it starts counting down the time setting. However putting in a significant amount of frozen food can significantly cool down the interior of a toaster oven, although with this oven the displayed temperature never changes. It can take the oven several minutes to come back up to the desired temperature, which doesn\'t give the full amount of cooking because the oven temperature has been low for several minutes. I avoid this problem by putting the frozen food in right away, right after I start the oven, before the preheat beep. Because there\'s a load of frozen food inside, it can take the oven several minutes more than usual to preheat, but when it beeps, the food is already in, and I know the interior temperature is at the full desired value, and that the interior will stay at the full temperature for the full time duration. I think this is a pretty safe way to cook, plus I have an electronic thermometer I can poke into the food to make sure it is hot enough. I have found the included tray and liner to clean up easily. They are not perfectly non-stick, but close enough. Toast comes out pretty nicely using the default setting, but be sure to place the wire rack in the lower slot, facing up. There are actually four different rack positions: upper slot facing up, upper slot facing down, lower slot facing up, and lower slot facing down. To toast the top and bottom of the bread evenly, put the rack in the lower slot, facing up. To tell the truth, as a single guy, I have gone literally years without using a full-size oven. And there are plenty of food items that you really can\'t microwave, they really need to be baked or broiled. Now that I have this toaster oven, though, I use it practically daily because it is so quick and easy and convenient.'),

(1963, 2, 1, 1, '2015-02-20', 'FIRE HAZARD FIRE HAZARD!  I bought one of these on Jan 9, 2015 and wasn\'t all that thrilled with it to start with. Making toast was difficult as the distance on the dial between \"barley warmed\" and \"burnt to a crisp\" is so short that it\'s a guess every time as to where to set it and you either ended up restarting it 2 or 3 times to get \"toast\" instead of bread or having it so burnt you had to throw it out and start over. I was considering bringing it back but got busy with other things and hadn\'t gotten around to it yet. THEN, the other night, my 17 year old son was making a piece of toast when the bread burst into flames inside the oven! Fortunately, he was nearby and noticed smoke coming from the oven fairly quickly so no damage was done - either to the house or the oven BUT had he gone off somewhere to do something else there COULD have been damage - and it COULD have been serious. Since I cannot trust that with 4 (or more) people using this toaster, that no one will EVER put in a piece of bread and walk away and leave it unattended for a few minutes, then I cannot trust having this appliance in my house. Fortunately, the toaster was new enough that I was able to return it to the store so I cannot speak to whether or not Black and Decker\'s customer service is any better than their toasters or not.'),

(1966, 9, 1, 1, '2016-01-20', 'lukewarm brown water - just what I wanted! Ugh, what a waste of time and money! I spent a lot of time reading reviews, even into page 10, to decide whether or not to go with the on-demand or with a classic Bunn. I wanted a coffee maker with a timer and one that could make a comparable brew to that of my manual pour-over method. This machine could do nothing of the sort on any level! Even after adjusting water, adjusting settings, adjusting amount of grounds as well as the grind itself, it still made the worst coffee. I think my $14.99 Mr. Coffee couldn\'t destroy quality beans like this one did! I\'ve had it two days, I attempted brews 3 times a day to absolute dissatisfaction. I should have taken more account on the other reviewers which will have similar complaints to mine: - the coffee was NEVER \"piping hot\" - not even close! Not during, at or after brewing. At the end of the shut off time? The coffee was barely even warm , after sitting there for two hours over the heat unit?! Unacceptable. I use exactly 2 tbsp of half n half to 4c of coffee - because the coffee was never hot after brewing, the coffee certainly wasn\'t hot after I put my half n half in it. Thanks, but no thanks. - the coffee was just GROSS. I\'ve never been so annoyed at having to use my locally roasted beans in order to find a way for this machine to make a brew that was full-bodied and kept the taste of the roast honest. I used every setting - 1-4 c and regular, I used just the gold filter, I used just a paper filter, I used both the paper filter in the gold filter, I adjusted the grind from fine-medium, medium, medium coarse, I measured out exactly the same amount of coffee (and water) that I use every day and couldn\'t replicate the brew with this machine. Just gross. Watery. Bitter. No depth. You name it, nothing decent about what was extracted out of some really great beans (that I have been preparing and drinking for months!) came out of any brew cycle that I attempted with this unit. - the coffee gauge quit today (on the second day), and as others mentioned, it was pretty hokey, fairly inaccurate, and thus, not very useful for its intention - it\'s profile is HUGE, be prepared to find a way to find space for it on the counters, and no, you can\'t open up the lid with wall cupboards, you have to pull the unit out, push it back in, blah blah blah - first world problem for sure, but, it\'s huge and that could be a detraction to many. - that cord thing that everyone is talking about? The struggle is real. I read about it before I bought it and I thought I was immune/informed. When I rec\'d the unit, I went to pull on the cord to get more cordage out as many reviewers mentioned. No go. I pulled more. I pulled to a point where I thought I might break it and then I went back to reviews...and spent another half hour digging through reviews to find out if I was crazy or not. In the end, I went back to the unit and I completely REEFED on the stupid cord and it finally came free. Why this has to be the case is pretty annoying - and you could easily send the whole machine flying if you didn\'t have it bolted down, the way you have use so much force to yank that stupid cord out! - the removable water tank? Another ergonomic/usefulness miss - You can\'t see what you\'re putting in there unless you tip it up towards you in the sink - which makes the water level at an angle, and thus, immeasurable. So, you have to set it down on the counter, wait for water to level, see if you hit the mark, go back under the faucet..back and forth, back and forth. About that high profile? My sink isn\'t very big - but thankfully I have a high arching faucet - otherwise, getting water into that tank from the sink/faucet would be even more obnoxious. By day two, I just filled my coffee mug with the water I needed and poured it into the water reservoir while it was still attached to the unit. It\'s pointless to remove the water reservoir to fill it. You\'ll see what I mean the first time you fill it and want a specific water level. - the on-demand pour was slow, just slow, obnoxious...the handle that you push down seemed like it required much more force than seemed necessary. The light? Hokey. Really, who needs a light? You can SEE how much coffee you\'re putting in your cup. Just LOOK at your cup - since you have to stand there for five minutes with your finger on the pour button while you\'re waiting for 8 oz to dribble out..... - the clock setting buttons: wow, like others, I thought they were broken! They don\'t push in/out by much, they\'re not responsive AT ALL, after you\'ve braced the machine from the back with one hand while trying to mash down the hour or minute button to get it to scroll up or down. Seems like something rudimentary as far as mechanics and interface go, but, another \"cheap\" feature on this expensive machine - speaking of \"cheap\" - I had a Hamilton Beach version what seems like a 100 years ago (probably about 7) that was as you would expect a HB machine to be - sort of good looking, but not stainless, mostly plastic, full-featured, and medium expectations of workability and brew. Well, this $100 stainless Cuisinart surrounded by plastic and cheap gimmicky plastic features is hands down far worse than any HB machine I\'ve ever owned. The HB had a viewable tank (to see how much you had left), not a crappy inaccurate hokey \"dial\", it has an easy push and fast fill on-demand system, it had the time/clock/programmable features, it made a decent cup of coffee, and it made it HOT, kept it HOT, it was worth it\'s $40 and performed about 110% better than this abomination did. - I\'ve been awake every morning at 6am, hoping it would be the day that I made this coffee machine work/make a good cup of coffee, but instead, spent the last half hour writing this review now that I have it packaged up in the return box and waiting for UPS to come pick it up. Just a total joke of a coffee maker. I should have known better - simple is better when it comes to coffee and I\'ll just go back to my simple pour over brewing method. No more gadgets, no matter how novel or what they\'re dressed up in, or, what their brand name is. Sad. As many others stated, \"I really wanted it to work.\"'),

This one actually makes toast pretty well, along with the other things a small toaster oven does, and is reasonably priced - that\'s the good part. Bad part is the controls- there are three almost identical knobs that all have to be turned to the correct  spot to toast, bake, broil, whatever. If you have one in the wrong place, well, things don\'t work as expected. The icons are pretty small too, so you have to look closely  to make sure  you you\'ve chosen bake instead of broil and such. In addition, the timer ( bottom ) knob, which as normal turns to the right to set the time, and toast darkness- no problem there. But if you want to finish early, you naturally just  want to turn the knob all the way to the left- there\'s the problem, all the way to the left puts it into \"always on\" mode, and there\'s no good feel where that happens. You have to find the exact spot between timer and on to turn it off. AND opening the door doesn\'t turn it off either. I could see this as a safety hazard, you could easily leave the oven on all day. Just a little better thinking would turn this into a \"best buy\". As specific solution, 4  buttons for toast, broil, bake and warm could take the place of the middle knob, and the toast button could override the toast setting on the top knob,  it\'s redundant. As is, you get what you pay for.'),

The broiling feature is nice and it bakes evenly as well. The thing I do not like about the toaster is that it does not have a bottom that opens to easily clean out the crumbs on the bottom. Instead they give you an insert to put in the bottom that comes out - but without a bottom hatch this can get messy. One thing to note: this toaster oven has a 3 prong power cord that is very short. It\'s made short so you do not trip over it or cause any injury from an untidy cable. If you need to use an extension cord like I do it\'s a good idea to find one with 3 prongs as well.

I do not make toast often, but when you want toast, you want it. My son has a toaster oven his family uses frequently. I decided to peruse the Amazon toaster oven reviews, and I found this toaster oven to be the most reviewed and best liked. The toaster oven came well packaged and easy to unpack. There are two quick use pamphlets, one in English, French, and Spanish. The directional pamphlet I  found wanting. It gives good directions on the parts of the toaster oven, how to make toast, and the assorted trays. However, there is no information on baking, how long a food might take etc. There are four modes, warm, bake, broil and toast. I have made toast several times to try it out, and this toaster is quite nice. I like medium brown toast and set the knob where that mode might be. I was correct, nicely browned toast. I wanted to brown the top of a cheese dish and used the broiler, I watched carefully, and it broiled to my satisfaction. This toaster oven is a good size for my kitchen. A 2 foot long 3 prong plug. The instructions recommend leaving the toaster oven unplugged until you use it. The toast crack and trays I hand washed before using, and will hand wash when needed. For the price, I think this is a good basic toaster oven. No big bells and whistles, but it has all you might need. Recommended. prisrob 03-10-16'),

The noises it makes are an embarrassment. If I can\'t clear the terrible flavor by tomorrow I will return it. When I called Keurig\'s customer service number they harassed me for all sorts of information rather than helping me even though I bought this machine through them on my membership points. They left me on hold for 10 minutes so I hung up. I drink over $100/month of Keurig coffee, so it is not like I am anti Keurig.

I\'ve had it now for a week and I\'ve used it every day.

Since getting this machine I\'ve actually cut my coffee consumption. It is also a lot faster to brew a single cup than half a pot. I hesitated purchasing one because of the non-reusable pods, reviews of other models, etc. However, when I researched the newer models (i.e. K200) it got so many great reviews I decided to give it a shot and I couldn\'t be happier. Yes, the pods are expensive but if you purchase the PureJava reusable pod refill and use your own coffee you\'ll wonder why you didn\'t purchase one sooner.

The front bottom heating element seemed became warped to the point that I had a very difficult time pulling out the crumb tray and also putting it back into the oven.

I loved it so much that I bought another one for $20 from someone who never used hers. Yep, I\'m Keurig crazy now. Not to mention that I\'ve got my son AND hubby hooked. I was afraid that other brand K cups wouldn\'t work in this, but they do. I actually found some at the Dollar Tree- 4 for a dollar.... and it\'s delicious. I don\'t know about those of you who are coffee snobs, but you might want to give those a try before making judgement. Anyway, I am in LOVE with this thing. I actually created an entire little coffee bar for it. So some of you say that it doesn\'t make enough coffee for a larger cup, and I haven\'t taken the time to try the hacks that are out there to unlock the larger options, but I don\'t really need to. So here\'s what you do... if you have a 16 ounce cup, opt for the 10 ounce and let it fill. Then, lift the thingy and put it down again. Next, choose the 6 ounce option using the same k cup. If you absolutely HAVE to have SUPER strong coffee, then you might want to use a second k cup, but I wouldn\'t because it\'s still strong after the second brew. If you use \"Donut Shop\" coffee, it\'s strong even after the second brew. If you drink a ton of coffee and like the dollar store k cups, I\'d order them from the Dollar Tree dot com web site and have them shipped to the store without paying for shipping. Imagine, 25 cents a cup? Or even 50 cents. That\'s a heck of a deal. In any case.. as I always say, I haven\'t had any problems with my Keurig so I\'d highly recommend it to anyone. So there you have it. I love my Keurig!.'),

Our faceplate wasn\'t broken, and hasn\'t broken yet. I took it apart (annoying) to see if ours might break eventually, but it was fine inside. No cracks, or weirdness. I noticed the two pegs were slightly wider than the holes in the control board where they go, so I widened the holes and replaced the plate while being careful not to over tighten the screws. Looks good for now! Someone else said the carafe leaks all over or something. Well, our carafe pours very well with no drips, but I can see how if you tried to dump it all out at once the coffee might overflow the little dam near the spout and go everywhere. The plastic of the housing is rather soft and pliable, but seems to stay very clean from coffee. The top of the housing is a little warpy, and looks cheap. But, this seems to be a purely aesthetic problem. Since I opened mine to check out the faceplate issue, I can say that the interior seems well put together and didn\'t observe anything else that might become a problem. Also there is, of course, one abnormal screw in the bottom which prevents users from opening it with a normal philips. I had to make a screwdriver to get it out. The coffee is waaay better than our old mr coffee type brewer, and we like the adjustable temp warming pad. If you\'re cheap like me, then give it a try! You can always just glue the faceplate back on, since the two pegs where screws hold it on are the only thing that breaks, and the control board behind it is sealed up independently of the plate.

I had a Hamilton Beach designer brand whose name I can\'t remember now. It also was programmable, had a removable water reservoir, and a pause & serve capability -- my three main requirements. You can never tell whether that last feature really works until you actually use the machine. I\'m very pleased that the feature works well on this unit. My last coffee maker drove me nuts. Every time I removed the carafe to pour coffee while it was still brewing, water would drip all over the burner below because the stopper didn\'t properly close. It didn\'t take long before the non-stick coating was almost completely worn away and no matter how much I cleaned it, it looked unsightly. The first time I used this coffee maker I very slowly and carefully removed the carafe while the coffee was still brewing, fully expecting the dribble onto the burner from a poorly seated stopper -- but it never materialized! No drip! I love that! I\'ve had this unit since last December and I often remove the carafe for my first cup before it\'s done brewing. Still no drip.

We kept getting error codes saying the pod would not work. From what I\'ve read there\'s a new technology in the cups. Not sure why they changed this aside from limiting you to buy \"keurig\" brand cups. One upside is they do say they will replace the ones that don\'t work with ones that do. I have yet to contact them to see how that works though. ۢ the pot does not come with this so you have to purchase it separately. Some of them do, just depends on the seller, which I also find odd.

Thought this pot might work but it does not - although zojirushi filter holder can rest on this pot and fits in the zojirushi body. Now for B&D.  It needs a flat bottom filter.  #2 cone filter from zojirushi, when flattened, can handle about 3 scoops of coffee ground.  I made 2 cup coffee and the quality (taste, heat) is about the same as zojirushi.  B&D operation is about the same and cleaning up as well.  I can buy 3 B&D for one zojirushi and if I break the next one I already ordered, I think B&D will be a serious contender.  Zojirushi is about 4 years old and still working as if new.  I can\'t say for B&D longevity, and will keep it for emergency times. Only weakness I see (trying new) with B&D is how the handle attaches to the pot.  Metal ring on the bottom is good, but the top is held with less than 1/8\" of plastic which may snap sometime in the future.

What I like about Keurig in general is the lack of dishes to wash. I am a stay at home mom during the day but I work at night, usually until midnight. I\'m not really in the mood to wash my coffee carafe and filter basket at 12:20am, and even less so when I crawl out of bed with the kids at 7:00. What I like about this particular Keurig is the \"strong\" setting. It makes a great cup of coffee, tastes just like drip, with the reusable K cup filled with the coffee of my choice. It\'s almost too strong, like the coffee at Starbucks, when I use the strong setting with the Peet\'s Alma De La Tierra organic dark roast K cups I bought at Costco. I think the whole proprietary K cups thing is pretty lame and I don\'t have the time or interest to sit around hacking stuff.

This time we wanted an upgrade and a smaller model, so we bought the K250 2.0.  I have been completely  disappointed with the purchase.  Keurig worked hard to develop a system that prevents you from using other pods but left off simple conviences of not having to adjust your cup size every single brew, not allowing more than 4 or 6 oz\'s for hot water and having a max size of 10 0z.  Who in the USA drink a 4 or 6 oz anything?  My coffee mug and my tea mug are the same so instead of giving me the same options I have to brew twice to get hot water for tea.

The regular brew and bold brew options are good, as I like my coffee strong and the rest of my family likes a regular brew of coffee. They love it too. The coffee maker right next to it is almost never used anymore, unless there are several people who want coffee at the same time. I also used it to make hot cocoa, but put the cocoa packet in the cup, as the basket cannot be filled that much, but it also came out great.

I love just about everything this machine this machine offers. It has enough features and adjustments for the average coffee drinker: fast and quiet, programmable on/off, 1-4 cup brewing option. It\'s beautiful and I like the design of the removable reservoirs for both water and coffee. Here\'s how this machine has disappointed me: 1)  The clock function stopped working within a few months. Ironically, I could still adjust the auto on time, but I could no longer adjust the time of day (it\'s on a different setting). Not a big deal until daylight savings time... 2)  Yesterday the coffee reservoir drained out onto the counter. The cause doesn\'t appear to be a clogged coffee filter or improperly placed reservoir. Not sure what the cause is, but it\'s intermittent. I\'ve brewed three pots of coffee since yesterday morning with no issue. Unfortunately, this problem is substantial enough for me to get rid of the machine. Being late for work due to cleaning up a mess from a leaky coffee machine is unacceptable. 3)  Short warranty period. Judging from the reviews, Cuisinart is well aware of this issue yet the warranty period is very short. 90 days I think. I\'ve had my machine for 10 months so I\'m out about $70.

Lasted 13 months. Brewed approximately 500 pots and then suddenly stopped working. Number 2, it vents steam out of the top as it brews, damaging the underside of the cabinet. It had to be pulled out on the counter for each use and that was kind of a pain, especially if other food prep was going on. I wouldn\'t recommend this machine.

You have to get used to setting knobs in the right position before setting the timer. Lastly, the knobs require guessing. The temp knob, for example, goes from 400 to 450.

It is absolutely useful for heating up bread and leftover pizzas or frozen fries. I have also tried baking cookies (yes, raw cookie dough) with this oven and the cookies turn out great. The oven heats up quickly, so I only let it preheat around 1-2 minutes before I start putting my food in. There are lots of modes and may seem complicated, but it really isn\'t. The first button is used for setting temperature, while the second one is for oven settings such as broiler, bake, and toast. The last button is for the timer. I also love the removable crumbtray that is placed at the bottom of the toaster; you can easily pull that out  and dispose of any remains that may have fell during the baking process. The baking tray that came with this oven is a major concern though. It is so flimsy and thin that my tray already has browned spots on it after multiple use. It\'s even worse because I use aluminum foil to cover that tray every time I use it, but it still has a brown spot. It is also way too small such that I cannot hold a lot of food in it, thus causing me to have to split my baking into 2 batches. I\'m only able to overlook this because of the great heat setting and the pricing of this product.'),

This coffee maker stores the coffee in a heated reservoir for 2 or more hours, and I quarter-fill my cup by pressing on the dispensing tab. The coffee stays hot at least 2 hours, and probably for 3 or more. There is a meter above the tab that shows how much remains in the reservoir. Even at 3 hours the coffee is hot but does not taste warmed over or boiled down. The water reservoir can be removed to fill at the refrigerator. The coffee reservoir and the cone filter basket have handles to remove them for rinsing or washing. I have not used the programmed start, but coffee is ready in under 6 minutes.

I especially love the removable reservoir that I can fill at the sink and snap in place again.  Unfortunately, lately, after @ 1 year, the reservoir is causing a problem.  The coffeemaker sputters and spews steam instead of brewing coffee.  I read other reviews and found the problem identified as either the need for cleaning or the reservoir\'s seat.  Cleaning didn\'t help but when the sputtering starts, I can remove the reservoir and slam it in place and it will make the pot of coffee.  It\'s a shame because otherwise I consider it to be perfect.  I will probably disassemble it and try to identify the problem further and probably break it.  Update: Success! I took it apart and found the problem. A semi-hard deposit like a little whitish stone formed in the intake tube and blocked the incoming water.  Note: I have well water. That explains why some people say cleaning works and some say slamming the reservoir in place works... both would work.  They really don\'t want you taking this apart.  It has four screws in the bottom, one of which is a security screw needing a special flat screwdriver with a notch in the center.  The intake tube is orange and is held in place by mini hose clamps.  I took the end of the tube off nearest the reservoir opening.  When I did the little \'stone\' fell out.  I guess I\'m good for another year.'),

(2601, 1, 1, 4, '2016-10-29', 'It\'s a good one.... I was skeptical about this model before I tried it, thinking the low tech model is easiest and reliable, and the latest and greatest model would have better features. But this one worked out beautifully. BEST features are the sleeker design and the strength control. (Over the low tech model, you also gain the carafe size and quieter process.) Things you\'ll MISS from the latest and greatest model are the Mug option and the ability to program the night before. (But the sleeker size is a gain.) My take on other review comments..... - I\'ve experienced no major dripping problem, but I wait for the screen to show it\'s finished before I grab the cup. - Yes there\'s condensation on the reservoir lid, and a colored top would be nice, but it\'s less visible in the back, therefore less bothersome to me. - No it\'s not lightning quick, but a little multitasking will prevent you from the urge to hover, then it\'s ready before you know it. - At first I was frustrated by how much water is required to brew a single cup, and that the screen won\'t move without adding some, but once I started filling the reservoir, it seemed less problematic. (I think more than a half liter remaining is required to move forward.) - I like knowing there\'s a workaround by using the  cover of a Keurig pod over a non Keurig pod, though there\'s plenty of inexpensive quality Keurig pods available. But even better is a reusable 2.0 pod with paper filters from BB&B. I\'ve easily used both reusable KCup and KCarafe pods before, to maximize flexibility and minimize cleanup and waste. - If you\'re going to use a carafe, I recommend the INSULATED one, based on experience with another model. Though this model does heat the water hotter for carafes than for cups, it\'s probably still a good investment. Overall, I\'ve been very happy to have this model on my counter. If you\'re serving a lot of people without a sink nearby, such as in an office environment, a model with a larger reservoir might be in order.'),

I have been using my new Keurig 2.0 coffee maker for a little over 3 weeks now and overall I would say I am pretty impressed with it. Comparing to my old office pro it is much quieter and compact and certainly doesn\'t drip as much liquid or splash outside of the cup making it an easy clean up. Although I chose black, I also love the other color choices making it an easy gift for any occasion. The DRM sensor really doesn\'t bother me since I use all Keurig KCups anyway but I can see it being annoying for someone who likes coffee that isn\'t yet in KCups. I don\'t like that the maker doesn\'t have an auto shut off/turn on and that the lid on the back comes completely off every time you fill the water tank which also has a ton of condensation that builds up on the lid when you leave the coffee maker on all the time. I realize that if I was to get a higher model that these features would be on it but I think its something simple to even put on the lowest model.

It is shaped in a way that if I am holding my cup in hand and pouring the last bit of the pot into the cup, hot coffee drips out the sides of the lid and onto my hand, ouch. That being said, I only had to do that once to realize that I just need to set the cup on the counter and wipe up any spillage.  The control features for brew \'bold\' and brew \'regular\' are ok I guess but not sure if it made that much difference in taste. The look of the maker is nice and compact, the clock is great, and I like the settings that reduce the temperature of the plate avoiding scorching.

Around that 2 year point it stopped working.  Tinkering with it suggested that lack of cleaning had allowed debilitating calcium build up - my fault.  No big deal, two years was a decent life. Ordered a new one from Amazon.  Within two weeks the silver cover over the buttons fell off.  The plastic posts holding it on (screws come in from the back/interior) disintegrated and broke.  Figured it was a fluke and sent it back to Amazon for a replacement.  Replacement did the same thing in the same timeframe.  Bad batch?  Sent the replacement back for replacement.  Same thing happened in just over a month Unfortunately, this put it outside of the Amazon replacement time limit.  Contacted HB directly.  After several emails and sending copies of receipts they responded with their warranty coverage option.  They said normally, I would have to send them the bad unit (about $12 of shipping) but they would accept a photo of the cord having been cut off.  (as if I could not fix that if I were trying to scam them)  Then within 2 weeks they would ship another unit back to me.  BUT...I would need to pay for that shipping.  So I would have to call to pay for that with a CC. Sooo, their idea of extra special CS on a problem that happened 3 times and is obviously a systemic or production flaw was for me to be without a coffee maker for 2 to 3 weeks and to pay a third of the cost of the unit.  All of that to get a unit that experience suggests will last about a month.  To be fair, the unit still made coffee without the trim plate, but what else might break?  and has inner parts exposed did not seem to be a good idea. Despite our initial positive experience with this brand and model, the evidence suggests that their quailty/quality control/manufacturing/materials have declined to unacceptable levels.

The amount of water you add is the amount of coffee that comes out, so pretty fool proof. We then tried it with just regular ground up coffee, and unfortunately there was some grounds that got in the cup of coffee. It is possible that the coffee was too finely ground, and that was the issue - as we do grind our own coffee beans. I have not tried it with regular coffee that you purchase ground already, as I said, this may make the difference. Or perhaps the little round coffee packets already in the filter would work better. Over all, I am very happy with this product. It has a nice slim design, so it should fit easily on your counter.

My previous Keurig, which quit working after 2 years, was a full sized Keurig and I loved it. I live in an apartment and I have a small kitchen, so when I saw this smaller Keurig, I purchased it. This Keurig has a touch screen that gives you the option or 4, 6, 8 or 10 ounce cup choices.  On top of that, you can press the \"strong\" button and it will make your coffee considerably stronger.  This is nice, because there are times where I would like to fill my travel mug with 10 ounces, but I don\'t want to lose the flavor. The manual explains how to clean this Keurig.  None of the parts are dishwasher safe.  It also won\'t take non-Keurig brand cups.  I love Keurig, but I think that was a nasty move.  I truly hope that someone comes along and makes a better product that does take K-cups, and hurts Keurig financially because of it. This machine is louder then my old one, and it sounds funny when it brews.  It is hard to explain the sound, but it\'s an odd sound.  It\'s like it pulses.  You can\'t set this one to brew automatically, and it doesn\'t have a clock on it.

We bought this knowing how it worked.  I\'m giving this 4 out of 5 stars for two reasons.  First, the tank gauge is a little sticky, just like some of the other reviews have stated.  If you tap the top of the machine the needle will reset to show the amount of coffee remaining.  On the other hand, I never knew how much coffee was left in our old carafe so it\'s no big deal to me.  The second reason is the tank takes a little effort to clean.  However, the temperature at which the tank keeps the coffee and the ease of pouring a cup (the LED light showing how much is in your cup) are worth the effort.'),

Mostly, I LOVE the removable water reservoir and that\'s the primary reason I bought it. It is very easy to wash out the reservoir if a bug has gotten in there. It is almost impossible to wash out the water reservoir on the other style of drip machines.

(2815, 2, 1, 4, '2016-05-16', 'It\'s inexpensive and it does the trick! I puzzled over whether or not to spend upwards of $250 for a convection toaster oven.  I decided to save myself the money and go for this one because it was highly rated.  I\'m glad i did. Some people say they\'re confused by the three knobs - here\'s the quick and dirty explanation: The top knob controls the top element, the middle knob controls the bottom element, and the bottom knob is the timer. The various combinations of the top and bottom elements create the bake, broil and toast function. The timer sets how long your food is exposed to the various combos.  Pretty simple. Pros: at $30, you can\'t beat the price It toasts like a champ (better than our toaster) It broils pretty well too I haven\'t used the baking function, so I can\'t yet speak to that. easily removable crumb tray makes cleanup easier. Cons: It doesn\'t pull out the rack when you open the door.  Not a huge deal, but you\'ll need to keep tongs or hot pads handy The cook tray isn\'t nonstick  - easily remedied with aluminum foil. The glass on the top is exposed when you open the door - be careful! I got a nice little burn by accidentally brushing it after broiling. My own stupid fault for not paying closer attention. Overall I think this is a great value for quick meals when you don\'t want to fire up your oven.'),

Also, the few times we used the oven portion the items started to burn at about half the time the directions indicated they be cooked for. The toaster function is a joke, the bar that holds up the bread bent so now toast slides down and waffles and bagels roll to one side. Now every time I toast bread or waffles, they fold in half and slide down the side to get stuck on the teeth of the bar. I have to unplug it and fish everything out of there.

This review will cover my experiences good and bad with the product. If you are a coffee lover or drink coffee regularly you may be interested in my experiences. I, myself, am a daily coffee drinker always looking for the easiest, cheapest, and most effective way to get my caffeine fix. The Keurig 2.0 has made this desire better, and I think it will assist other coffee lovers as well. Ease of Use Have you ever found yourself wasting time, money, and effort making a whole pot of coffee in the morning only to take a fraction of it with you for the day? These troubles end with the Keurig 2.0 as you can easily make a single serving of coffee to fuel your day. Not only can you make a great brew, you can also spend little time cleaning up afterwards. The Keurig disposable filter cups can simply be pitched after use. If you choose to take the more economic route, no problem; Keurig makes a reusable filter to enjoy caffeine beverages time and time again. Appearance and Functionality The appliance itself is sleek, classy, and an attractive complement to other appliances in any kitchen. The product features a flawless touch screen display, giving it a modern and sophisticated feel. This display is the communication center for brew choices, the status of your brew, and issues the machine may detect. This feature can come in handy if/when there may be an issue with the system; although, I have not had any issues with its functionality. This brewer is not as wide as other Keurig models, so if youre like me this is convenient with limited counter space. Versatility You may be thinking, But what if I want to make more than just a single serving when company is over? The Keurig K250 2.0 also comes with the capability of use a carafe that holds up to four cups of coffee. The versatility and convenience of this Keurig has made my life much easier in the mornings. After all, a good morning routine and caffeine jolt will start any day off on the right foot. Keurigs Room for Improvement ۢ Only includes 8oz and 10oz brewing options. ۢ Does not include 2.0 reusable filter. ۢ Packaging does not effectively communicate to the consumer that the 2.0 reusable filters are different from all other Keurig models. ۢ Unit does not come with the carafe or a reusable filter specifically for the carafe. So far I have not had any issues with the functionality of the unit, and luckily the touch screen display has the ability to notify me in case a problem may arise. If youre like me and want an easy, effective, and economically efficient way to get your caffeine jolt in the morning, the Keurig K250 2.0 is a wise investment. I have enjoyed this appliance and I believe any other coffee junkie will too. Good luck, and happy brewing!.'),

However, once I started using it, I wished I\'d kept looking around. I had only used it for a couple months (not daily) when the toaster part on top no longer worked. When you push the handle down to \"toast\", it won\'t stay down. So, I have to toast my bread in the oven part - which doesn\'t toast evenly. I tried heating up some leftover pizza and had to cut the slices in half because the \"oven\" part is really small. The heating elements on the top and the wire rack are so close that sometimes my food burns because it touches the top. In summary - the food can\'t be too long, too high or too wide (the door won\'t stay closed). The only good thing I can say is it heats up quickly.'),

Some complaints are legit, like if it breaks soon after you get it, but I wonder at some of the exacting critiques and disappointments by some reviewers of their $50 coffee pot. Are they ever really satisfied with anything? This makes a perfectly fine, hot cup of coffee. I set it to Bold because that is how I like it, and it makes good Bold coffee. I set it to Regular once to see the difference, and it was definitely less Bold and more Regular. I havent used the 1-4 cup feature, but nice to have it. I like the narrow shape of this coffee maker, and the stainless/black material. It looks nice. Very happy with the blue backlight on clock. Steam does rise from the top of maker when it is brewing, not an issue for me but may be for some. Maker is lightweight so easy to pull out from under counter. I thought I would use the removable tank feature. Its nice to have it, but I just fill the pot with water and pour it in the tank. I like the push button swing-out feature for the filter. Some say it brews too slowly on Bold. But I turn it on, cook breakfast, and when I\'m finished cooking there is enough brewed coffe to fill 2 large cups.

Im a college student living at home, and I have to wake up very early in the morning, so Im usually in a hurry to get out the door. I have the Sandy Pearl color, and let me tell you, it looks absolutely beautiful in my room! (I love the ability to pick from many colors!) I wouldve chosen Turquoise, but Im hoping to take this with me to my apartment after I graduate, so I chose a neutral color. The heat up, in my opinion, is very quick. I plug my Keurig in, and it begins heating while I start getting ready. Once the sound stops, I put in my favorite cup or use a re-fillable cup and place a tea bag inside. There are many sizes and custom brewing options, which is great because I have so many different kinds of cups and mugs. Some only can hold 4-6oz. and others can hold 10oz. or more. I love the touch screenIts elegant AND easy! While heating and brewing make a decent amount of noise, its much quieter than the one my mother has. My little sisters room is adjacent to mine, and its never woke her up yet! The beverages are always extremely hot, which is great, considering that some days my cup sits there a while before Im ready to grab it, and I think that attributes to how well it brews bags of tea. Ive been pleasantly surprised with how much flavor of tea has made it into my mug without steeping. Now for the cons_ There arent many, but the ones it has, I feel, are pretty important. 1) Several of my travel mugs cannot fit under it (and yes, that is with the tray removed). My solution has been to place a different, smaller cup underneath the Keurig and transfer it into my travel cup afterwards. Its a nuisance, but it works. Luckily, for me, I dont use travel mugs every day, so its not that big of a deal. 2) Theres no auto-off feature. This is the biggest frustration for me. I have to unplug my Keurig after every use to conserve energy. One day I left it on and noticed it DID turn off, BUT then I did the same experiment two other days and it stayed on all day long_ (10+ hours) All in all, Im extremely satisfied with my purchase. The cons are nothing that cant be fixed with a few extra steps on my end, which in the end, doesnt matter as much. This little thing is still faster and easier than stopping by the coffee shop or boiling hot water on the stove for tea.

I am not typically a guy who searches out the cheapest thing especially when it comes to appliances or \"durable goods\". But with a toaster, I thought I would just give it a try. This toaster replaced an earlier, far more expensive, upscale model that performed just \"okay\" and lasted about ten years. Since I no longer really care about what visitors think about my purchase decisions and I am no longer interested in \"keeping up with the ...\", I figured this toaster would be fine.... as long as it worked the way it was supposed to. The one it replaced was also a Cuisinart..... long slot, beautiful finish, high tech controls, heated with fancy glow bulbs.... Well, the bulbs gave up and it seemed such a waste of time and dollars to try to replace them... especially since the toaster never performed nearly as well as it should have (considering the original price...).  So I decided to go the opposite way this time.  This Cuisinart toaster looks good, toasts two slices at a time, will accept and toast bagels and English muffins, and works the way it was designed (at least so far...!!). Toasting normal sandwich bread is easy. Set the darkness to the center (#4) and push the lever/handle down. Shortly you will have toast. Both sides toasted to a close approximation of each other.  If you toast other bread styles like the more upscale bakery breads (7-grain, Oatmeal-honey, All-grain, etc., ...) then you will probably need to set the control to #5 to get a satisfactory \"crunch\" on your toast. English muffins take longer (in all toasters..). Bagels toast fine too. If you use the special bagel \"feature\" (button..) then the bagel will toast mostly on one side.... And as long as you put the bagel into the toaster the same way each time, it should be mostly satisfactory.  I like the defrost setting... It works. I will usually keep a loaf or two of bread in the freezer... The defrost setting allows you to defrost and toast quickly. Should be a relatively simple process ... and apparently it is because it works the way it is supposed to. I like the wide slots and the way the toaster keeps the bread centered (mostly... as long as you aren\'t toasting really thin bread..). The cord is short, but that is to be expected because the law requires it. It can be routed around several little hooks on the bottom of the toaster so that it exits out from under the base on the side or the rear... whichever you prefer. Overall, I\'m happy.  If it quits tomorrow, I will send it back. If it quits after a few years, I will have received my money\'s worth of use.  No complaints.'),

Additionally, this one has a front-entry filter compartment, instead of a lift-top. I like that. It has a lift-out filter basket, so you don\'t burn your fingers removing a hot, wet coffee filter. Then you just tip the basket into the trash to dump the used filter. There are also 3 options to choose from for your \"keep warm\" temperature after brewing. The only improvement I would wish for - and this isn\'t a big enough deal for me to delete a star - would be to move the water tank from the back to the side, like on the Keurig. I have to move this machine slightly out from underneath the top cabinets to reach the water tank. This somewhat defeats the convenience of the front-loading filter basket, but I\'m working on finding an arrangement where I don\'t have to move it (because hey, I\'m a problem-solver).'),

It hold around 32 ounces which is four to six cups depending on your definition of a cup. ۢ The coffee is plenty strong and the temperature of the coffee is about right. It gets warmer if you leave it on the hot plate. The coffee tastes good if you use quality coffee grounds. ۢ I liked the price of the coffee maker. Cons ۢ Its easy to spill a few drops if you are not careful to pour slowly. ۢ I dont like the design where the showerhead is built into the water reservoir lid. This keeps you from opening the lid under the cabinet. All coffee makers seem to come this way today so I am not sure it is fair to reduce my rating because of this. I am sure most customers would rather pay the extra to have the old design. Features the coffee maker is lacking but would increase the price. ۢ Brew pause feature. This is not something I use because it makes the last cup weaker than the first. ۢ A programmable brew start, auto shutoff and digital clock. ۢ Some small coffee makers have these features but the ones I considered made less coffee. Other comments ۢ It takes around 10 minutes to make a full 32 once pot of coffee. I not sure how this compares to other coffee makers. ۢ I would buy this model again if I had to make the decision over again.'),

I own an older model that feels much more solid. Annoyances: -Old Keurig was push one button and get a full cup. New K200 makes me touch the dinky arrow in the tiny screen (from 1994?) to set a 10 ounce size that will fill my normal coffee cup. Then I have to press the physical brew button to brew the cup. Again, not a deal breaker but really annoying because it is totally unnecessary. Who approved the dinky arrow and dinky little screen? -Can\'t set large cup as default size. I have to tell it not to brew half a cup. Every time. Do the designers actually use this Keurig or pick up their coffee at Starbucks in the morning? -Lots of weird straining sounds when brewing. Way more so than older Keurig. -Handle mechanism feels cheap. -KCup is set deeper in unit than past Keurigs.This means that you stick your hand inside the Keurig instead of dropping the KCup into the old vertical holder. I then have to pick it out with my fingernails (not pleasant. If you are sharing this Keurig I guess you are sharing fingernail germs). And since cleaning supplies were included with the K200, I fear that this deepset KCup hole needs to be sanitized much more often. -Lots of condensation forms on inside of reservoir lid.

Amazon showed that it left their facility but UPS did not have it.  So it arrived Monday, 8/25.  Since it was late and we had a use for it over the weekend, I checked our local stores and found the same thing at Meijer for $5 cheaper.  Even with sales tax added it still ended up being $3.25 cheaper than Amazon\'s price.  Did not expect that.  Anyway, we will keep the one from Amazon for a spare, or maybe to use as a gift for some reason. The toaster seems to work quite well.  It is smaller than the one it is replacing so it heats up and gets done quicker, which is nice.  And it does get pretty darn warm on the outside.  Definitely not a good idea to have anything sitting on top of it or very close to it.  Controls are simple to use.  We have only used the toast function so far, so I don\'t know how it does on the other settings.  You do get to listen to the timer run down as the toasting cycle completes, but it isn\'t that bad.  I was toasting a sub sandwich without the drip tray in it.  Bad idea!  Grease dripped on to the bottom heating element and caught on fire.  Caused some smoke but no damage to anything.  The next sandwich I toasted I put the drip tray in and did have to increase the toasting time a bit as the tray deflects the heat from the bottom element from getting directly to the food, but I think it did a better job overall.  The bread wasn\'t dried out and cutting my gums or the roof of my mouth.  Hopefully it lasts longer than the one it is replacing.  If so, it will certainly be worth the investment.'),

I struggled with whether to give this a 2 or 3 star rating, as my experience falls between \"don\'t like it\" and  \"it\'s okay\", but I think it\'s better to round down in this case. Like many other reviewers, we gave this a try after breaking a couple of carafes on other machines and finding replacements to be too costly. The concept is great, but it doesn\'t deliver the most important thing: tasty coffee. We haven\'t experienced any leaking or overflowing, but the weak brew it produces is disappointing to say the least. Some experimentation will be required since tastes vary, but we\'ve settled on the following: -For 5 cups or less, use paper + gold filter and 1-4 setting -For 6 and up, use paper filter only One of the weakest aspects of the machine is that it considers 5 oz to be a cup instead of the standard 6 oz. This means that you\'re using an extra tablespoon of coffee to make two 12 oz servings, which still may be weak if you don\'t do it correctly. Some recommend grinding a bit finer, but if we wanted to do stuff like that, we\'d be using a french press and buying whole beans. We don\'t use the water filter since we\'re already filtering at our faucet, and I\'ve wondered if that\'s partly to blame; is the machine depending on it to slow down the water flow? Possibly, but even if it is, I\'m not willing to commit to buying those regularly. I\'ve also wondered about the included gold coffee filter. One with a solid bottom might yield better results, but we\'re already $90 in the hole here, so I\'m less than thrilled about spending more money to get a decent cup of coffee out of this thing. I saw another reviewer mention that they removed the float mechanism entirely since it\'s nearly impossible to clean. I\'d like to do the same, but I\'m hesitant to apply force. Overall? Keep looking. **Update 10/30/2015*** I removed the housing that contains the actual float and the mechanism that controls the gauge. It came out easier than expected, but would be very difficult to reinstall. That said, I have no interest in doing so as the inside of the housing and all parts within were FILTHY. When I say filthy, I mean absolutely covered in black residue, which makes sense as you can\'t really access it even with a bottle brush or something like that. Talk about a design flaw...'),

Then I found one at a thrift shop and bought it as a \"trial run.\" I loved it so much, but really wanted the red version, so I bought the red version and use the older (black) one for camping. Addressing some of the issues others have raised: It\'s small: Yes, this is true. But it will fit two good sized slices of pizza and so is big enough for most anything I want to use it for. If you use a toaster oven to cook for a family, it might not work for you, but for a single person it\'s perfect. No broiler: Also true. I find I don\'t miss it, when I want to broil something (not that often) I use my regular oven. No timer: Also also true. But I have a timer on my microwave and also a stand alone timer, so if I need a timer I use one of those. How many timers do you need in the kitchen anyway? Toasts unevenly: Not in my experience. Mine toasts just as evenly as any toaster I\'ve ever owned. PLUS (and this is a big deal) it has a window in front so you can watch your toast and pop it out when it gets the shade you want. Why aren\'t all toasters this way! :) The older version I bought at the thrift store did not have a \"cancel\" button, but this new one does. This lets you turn off the oven or pop up your toast without having to pull on a lever. The tray does hang up a little sometimes, it just takes the right touch to push it in. (This is what gave it 4 stars instead of 5...you\'d think they would have figured this out by now.) Bottom line for me is, this takes up WAY less room than most regular toaster ovens, let alone a toaster oven and separate toaster. It\'s retro cute and easy to clean. It holds any toast I\'ve thrown at it, and it cooks lots of oven-y things so I don\'t have to use the energy or generate the heat from the large oven. So I love my Toastation!

Cleaning is so easy, I found I can dump and clean the filter, wipe and dry out the machine before my coffee could even begin to cool down. It looks nice on the counter and takes up little space. I can use my smaller mug or add a bit more grounds and use my taller travel mug due to the adjustable height base. The cord may be a bit short if you need it a fair distance from the outlet. For me it\'s perfect because I have it right by the outlet and don\'t like the look of a long cord laying on the counter. Will it hold up? Don\'t know yet, but the build seems very solid, giving me no current concerns in that regard. I will be recommending this product to anyone who needs a single serve coffee maker. Excellent product!'),

It\'s as simple as you can get which is what I wanted. I didn\'t want or need anything with a bunch of bells and whistles. It is easy to clean and fits regular basket filters, which is a plus.  I gave it four stars because for the sake of honesty it does have a few minor issues that might bother some people.  I\'m not bother by them a whole lot though. 1.  It takes somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes to brew.  I know  some people want it done faster but I just start it before I do anything else in the morning and that works for me.  I\'m not ready for coffee the second my feet hit the floor anyway. 2. It does tend to collect condensation around the outside.  A little annoying but I just make sure to wipe it up when I see it. 3. Some people also complained about the lack of an automatic shut off.  I kind of wish it had that feature but I guess the lack of it just makes me pay better attention to what I am doing.  Maybe that\'s not such a bad thing! 4. I haven\'t had too much trouble with it dripping coffee on the hot plate as some reviewers noted.  Maybe they\'re trying to pull the pot away before it is totally done dripping? Every coffee maker I\'ve ever had requires a moment or two for the last couple of drips to stop.  Any drips I do get I mop up right away and my hot plate looks fine. 5. The pot does get a little messy when you pour. I\'ve had that problem with other coffee makers too.  I\'ve learned to avoid a mess simply by pouring over the sink and then wiping off the pot with the dish cloth.  Problem solved. Overall I\'m happy with this coffee maker.  It does what I need it to do and performs as well as can be expected for a $15 machine.'),

So I opened that one and there was the actual Keurig box. But I noticed that the Keurig box was damaged on the top. I thought it was weird but I opened it up and everything was in there. I didn\'t notice anything damaged on the Keurig so I began to set everything up. I filled the reservoir to the minimum line just like the instruction booklet says. I turn on my Keurig K250 and it\'s going through some sort of process where it\'s taking in water. Seems normal right? Then it goes to a screen saying \"pre-heating\" and after 3 minutes, it says \"lift to begin\". Everything seems to be going alright. The booklet says to lift the handle all the way and bring it back down without a K-Cup Pod and it will give you an option to pour some hot water into a cup. This is where it went wrong. The screen is stuck on \"lift to begin\". Weird. So I re-did everything and it\'s still stuck. I look online for possible solutions but they all say to either call Keurig customer service or take it apart. I went with option 1 and called them. The customer service was super nice and we went through the whole situation. The lady told me that she is going to send me a new Keurig straight from them but it\'s going to take 3-7 business days.

Choosing between 6, 8, or 10 ounce cup is simple with the integrated measuring reservoir. I think it\'s a good thing this maker does not have an internal water holding tank, using only the amount of water poured in for that particular cup being made at that moment. I believe any water holding reservoir type of brewer has the potential of mold. I refer to that type of brewing as replacement through displacement. This Hamilton Beach eliminates that possibility. It\'s fast too. By the time I get done adding creamer, sweetener, and a little evaporated milk to a freshly made cup, another cup is done brewing too. The choice of regular and bold brew is another feature we really like. Initially I thought maybe the difference between the two modes might be temperature but it turns out to be how the water is introduced into the K-cup or brewing basket with whatever your choice of ground coffee. The regular brewing mode continuously pushes the water through as with any K-cup brewer but what\'s different with bold mode is it will momentarily pause intermittently through most of the brew process. It really does make a difference too. My wife likes the regular brew mode and I like the bold mode. Wish we discovered this FlexBrew a long time ago.'),

You do have to turn the coffee pot upside down to get the last couple tablespoons of coffee out, but I don\'t drink that anyways (I find there\'s always a little bit of silt in the last couple tablespoons anyways). Turning it upside down is a little annoying, but it cleans really easily otherwise. The coffee is consistent and delicious. I\'ve used it almost every day.

(3061, 12, 1, 4, '2014-01-23', 'This is a great compact unit. This is the second Toastation Toaster Oven  I have owned.  The first one lasted for seven years of heavy use.  After seven years it still worked, but it no longer seemed to get as hot as it should. What I like best is the compact size of having two appliances in one.  I feel a top load toaster toasts more evenly than putting toast on the rack of a toaster oven.  One big improvement on this model is that you can push a button to make the toast pop.  In the older model (which is still available)  you had to unplug the toaster to make it pop up if you wanted to pop it up before the toaster thought it was finished.  Dumb design.  Another improvement on this model is that they repositioned the dials so that the toaster dial is on top and the other dial is below it.  That just makes sense to me, but on the older model these were reversed.  Lastly, I like having the option of the red enamel on the front, particularly because it is easier to keep clean than the stainless steel in my opinion.. I wish I could give this toaster oven 4.5 stars.  I wish they made this toaster oven available in a slightly larger size  .  Specifically, I wish it were a little bit taller.  My husband and I use the oven part often to heat things like pizza slices and sandwiches.  If the interior of the oven was a little taller  I think I would use it even more.

Toast will usually be browner on the bottom, with an uneven grill looking pattern. The thing that confounds me are the labels on the dials.  Defying all laws of physics and common sense, \"broil\" and \"toast\" are shown as temperatures and cooking modes on both dials.  So, your temperature could be \"toast\", but you could still have it on \"bake\" on the mode dial ... meaning you are baking at the highest temp.  You could also \"broil\" (a lower temperature) with both burners on.  It\'s just goofy and un-American.

While Cuisinart made some changes that were really needed for this model, they fell short in meeting my expectations and made other changes that negatively affected it. They made improvements to the dials from the previous version, but the dials are black, with no indication of the dial point, other than they raised it. By doing so, you can hardly see where, or what function it is pointing at. The indicator point should be silver, or white. The slot for the oven rack has been moved and the oven rack has a more curved angle to it. This is also not a positive aspect, because it now it has the toast why too close to the top. And for what ever reason, it just simply does not toast as well as the older model. The last fault in this toaster is that the sound when the cycle has completed. It is so loud, it will wake up the house when it goes off and I am not kidding. NOT A GOOD FEATURE! The major improvement is that they went to an all aluminum coated interior. This is a vast improvement from the painted interior of the older model. The older model\'s painted interior started chipping/burning away after time. This new interior is much better in appearance and way better to clean. While I still think the toaster and oven is superior to the other brands on the market, I think Cuisinart took a step backwards and is letting the competition catch up.'),

I also love that we can purchase the carafe optionally and brew larger pots when company comes over. I have yet to figure out if you can purchase a refillable pod that works with this machine. That\'s one thing I want to find out about still, since the pods are quite expensive! They\'re cheaper than a Starbucks run, though, so we have that going for us. :) I have found that many of our travel mugs are too tall to fit in this machine. That\'s a bit of a bummer. Our Starbucks \"grande\" sized mug BARELY fits underneath, and taller mugs will not work. I was hopeful that removing the drip catcher on the bottom would allow me to use a taller mug, but it appears that this piece HAS to be in place for it to brew (it\'s the same place the carafe connects, so that you HAVE to use their carafe, not any other pot). My husband loves the flavor of the coffee and variety of pods available, so he\'s ultimately a happy camper! Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.'),

The carafe is designed with a strip of plastic across the carafe which keeps the pot from dripping everywhere when you fill your cup, a great design innovation. The chamber which holds the grounds snaps open and is convenient.  The pot isn\'t as tall as my old pot and has a slightly smaller footprint.

The lid and the reservoir are plastic, (BPA-free) according to their website, but the carafe is of course, glass. I do miss the convenience of the Keurig, but this machine is super-easy to use and brews quickly and quietly.

(3206, 5, 1, 4, '2015-08-22', 'How to Start the Day as a Human This Hamilton Beach product is an attractive, reliable drip coffee maker, the kind that has the blessed black liquid ready for you as the day hatches.  So you can stagger into the kitchen drawn forward by the comforting smell of fresh coffee and work your phone with one hand, whisk scrambled eggs for an omelette with the other, and drink your java through a foot long, heat-resistant straw (not included) while slowly regaining consciousness.  This pleasant scenario assumes, of course, that you remembered to fill the handy removable reservoir, add coffee to the front-loading basket and program the machine the night before.  Hamilton Beach is a tried and true brand, and the price is reasonable for what you get, low enough to perhaps leave room in the budget for high-quality coffee.  Which, after all, is the main ingredient, that and spring water. The strength of your brew is a factor, too, which means a significant part of the final product has to do with how you prepare it. You will enjoy a number of agreeable features.  The controls are fairly intuitive, even for gadget-challenged users.  You can make a few cups or a full pot of 12.  Your second cup will still taste good thanks to the stay-warm feature, which protects the brew from that awful burnt taste.  (They do mean warm, though.  It wont be hot, but thats where a microwave comes in.)  I like the light heft of the pot, and the way it snicks into its cradle so you know it is seated properly. Yes, the pot is plastic and maybe we are all going crazy from exposure to plastic compounds, but glass is heavy and it breaks.  Another feature is the clever removable basket that holds the filters, which makes for easy transport across the kitchen.  Or you can order a permanent filter basket as an accessory.  You may not achieve that perfect cup of coffee we all dream about, but most days a decent cup of coffee waiting in the kitchen as one tries to regain human form is something to be grateful for.'),

I thought the crumb pan in this BLACK+DECKER would make cleaning easier, but since it lacks a lip in the back and you have to tip it to get it out it just drops crumbs in back. The crumb pan also doesn\'t clean up nicely in the dishwasher, so it should be hand washed. It does toast things nicely, but you have to manipulate three different setting to get that done. Also, unlike my old over, it doesn\'t turn off the toasting feature when you open the door and you have to be careful when you turn it off that you don\'t switch it too far because that is where the stay-on feature is-- a mistake I have already made once. The picture makes it look like there is more room in the oven than there actually is so while I used to be able to put slightly overfilled ramekins in my old oven, it isn\'t possible to do so with this oven, so I was disappointed in the height dimension. You could toast four small pieces of bread,but many specialty breads you will only be able to fit two slices.

That being said, it\'s not perfect, especially the toaster part. Regular bread and anything thinner is better made in the oven part, as it will curl from the heat if made in the toaster. This unfortunately takes away the convenience of a toaster that toasts bread on both sides at the same time. The toaster part works okay for thicker breads like bagels and English muffins. The toaster oven works fine, like a broiler, so you will have to turn over whatever you are cooking if you want to toast both sides. I highly recommend a short roll of tin foil to use on the cookie sheet included as it is not a non-stick surface. It\'s also not the easiest thing to clean; even though there is a removable crumb tray, many crumbs still fall beneath it and it\'s hard to remove them all.

Here\'s a photo of the mess afterward. Sometimes it will work again if unplugged and plugged into the electric outlet, sometimes it won\'t. Many pods that used to work now don\'t, what do we do with those on hand? Throw them out? Be aware of this if you opt to get a K250.

When you\'re returning the carafe to the hotplate, it slides back in easily without catching on the edge of the hotplate.  The filter holder is easy to remove.  Whether you use the removable water reservoir or just pour the water into it, it\'s a snap. That\'s all I ask of my coffeemaker.  I don\'t care about all the bells and whistles some have.  I don\'t want a coffeemaker taking up half my kitchen counter.  I don\'t want a coffeemaker that I have to refer to the owner\'s manual every other day to operate.

I makes toasts fine.  Yes, it ticks while it is on, but that keeps you from accidentally leaving it on (which I did with my old oven.)  The unit looks & feels well made.& it is easy to clean the tray--it slides out from the front. This is a good value for this unit. I regularly make toast, and have warmed pizza, and baked potatoes.

It has been hard to get used to the dial for the toast (instead of a push button) and we end up with a lot of burned bread. The smaller profile means that, while my old toaster oven dish fits in this oven from a horizontal perspective, it is usually too close to the top of the oven and things just get burned. Also, the single heating element runs right down the middle and is completely exposed, so it gets dripped on a lot and will probably shorten its life. When this one wears out I will fork out for the better model. If you really just use it for toast (and not for cooking) you will probably be OK.'),
(3388, 4, 1, 1, '2015-02-01', 'Melting Heating Elements I purchased this Cuisinart TOB-40 in May 2013 and initially I was really pleased with it.  I have a very small kitchen and this unit didn\'t take up half my counter space, I liked the way it looked, the ease of operation, the way it toasted the bread, baked, warmed, etc.  In fact, I like everything about it UNTIL about three months ago.  I just happened to notice that one of the heating elements on the bottom was melting and was nearly touching the bottom of the toaster-oven.  It could have happened earlier but I just noticed it then.  I have been afraid to use it as I believe it to be a fire hazard.  Since my toaster-oven is/was still under warranty, I contacted Cuisinart and I was told that I would have to pay to have it shipped back to them and that I needed to insure the package, PLUS I would have to pay Cuisinart \"a shipping and processing fee of $10.00 to have the new one shipped to me\".  I then went to Amazon.com to read the product reviews and was appalled to read that so many other people were/are having the exact same problem and were told they too were responsible for the shipping cost to return the product to Cuisinart.  I didn\'t see where anyone was told that they would have to pay the $10.00 fee for processing the new toaster.  I guess that may be a new requirement.  I think this is ridiculous since obviously Cuisinart is fully aware of this flaw in that model oven.  One can purchase a new toaster oven for nearly the same amount and not have all the hassle of packing up and returning the defective one.  Has anyone has the problem with a heating element melting with any of Cuisinart\'s other model toaster-ovens?'),

So now I can make myself two or three large mugs and not waste any coffee and each is brewed when I want it. It has a normal and bold setting, I only like the bold setting for brewing coffee grounds. I normally use cheap coffee, Store brand or something, but the darker brew so the coffee comes out strong enough. I did add like a quarter lb of starbucks coffee I had ground to the regular 3 pound coffee can and it made it really nice if you like more bite in your coffee. Anyway I think once you figure out how you like to make your coffee this thing works great and very easy to clean. It took me just two trys both with the ground section filled to the line and mug size filled to line and pushed the normal button and then same setup but pushing the bold button, and I was happy with that setup and using the bold button.

On the first one, the bottom heating element got a large bubble in it that looked like it was going to pop any day.  It was still under warranty so Cuisinart shipped me a new one.  Got the new one last year and we have the same issue, but this time the element isn\'t getting a bubble, however  the whole element on the bottom now has an enormous bend in it and each time we use it and it\'s glaring orange, it looks like it\'s going to break.  If the bend reaches any higher it will hit the rack.  Again, this is a serious fire hazard but Cuisinart made it clear last time they would not be replacing it again for free for me, as it was past warranty.

Obviously, we are having to purchase another toaster oven. I decided to purchase the Waring 650 this time because it seemed to have an over-whelming number of positive reviews compared to negative reviews. I noticed on other models of the Cuisinart toaster ovens -- there were reviewers who indicated that they had problems with the heating element cracking as well. It seems to me that Cuisinart should have had their engineers correct this problem by now. As I stated before my unit was purchased in 2011.

It is going back.  The first piece of toast, set to light, came out light but totally dried out - bread crumb dry.  I set the next slice for the 1/2 darker setting and it burned to a crisp because the toaster didn\'t shut off.  It was smoking, really!  Somehow it kept moving to a setting called \"stay on.\"  The first slice at least shut off. Instructions say to turn it past 10 (very easy) and then turn back to the setting you want for the toast.  Do you know anyone at the gym with strong hands?  I had to get the rubber thingie I use to open jars to turn the dial backwards, as instructed.  What has happened to simple toaster ovens?  Thank goodness I haven\'t trashed my more than 10 year-old toaster oven (also Black and Decker).  I\'ll just go back to it.  Very disappointed in them.  I might have kept trying it for awhile longer if it didn\'t take such effort to turn the darn dial back to light and if the toaster setting would shut off every time.  Had I not been nearby, would the toast have caught fire?  I don\'t know but am not willing to take the chance.'),

It\'s also small enough to tuck away in a cupboard.  I make a smoothie, dump it into a glass, and then rinse the blender clean right away.  (It\'s easier to clean dried-on goo from a glass than a blender. Sometimes I forget the smoothie glass in my car.  Gross.)  I have a little old hand vacuum that I love.  It\'s so old but it works GREAT.  I have actually duct taped the cracks in it, and I refuse to throw it away, because I can\'t find another vacuum that works as well, and they don\'t make this one anymore.

I would expect it to be the other way around. There is a major drawback with this unit that caused us to return it. The door has no spring to hold it closed or counter-balance the weight of the very heavy door, so the door wants to fall down to the counter which is very loud every time the handle hits the counter. The door could easily slip out of your hand and crash to the counter, breaking the glass.

We bought it to replace an aging Proctor Silex toaster oven. We should have gone to a store to see the toaster in person. The picture is a bit deceiving in that it seems to have a spacious cooking area, but the rack is very close to the top heating element, and the instructions state you are not to allow whatever you are heating to come within 1 1/2 inches from the top. This poses a problem since there is barely 3 inches clearance between the rack and the element.  Another instruction says you are not to use any foil in the oven. It does not come with any baking tray so this also limits what can be heated. The outside of the unit becomes very hot when in use, and this may be typical, but the handle also gets quite hot.

We bought the Cuisinart brand (even though it was a little more expensive) because almost all of our small home appliances are Cuisinart. In fact, yesterday we celebrated 42 years of marriage, and we still have our 42-year old Cuisinart food processor that travelled with us to four different South American countries! Cuisinart has never failed us once, except with their oven/broiler we bought. The on/off switch just stopped working. This is very disappointing for my husband who is an Executive Chef at a 4-star restaurant. He liked using the oven/broiler for home use. But getting only 2-1/2 years out of an appliance that only kept food warm and toasted bread, is outrageous.  I am very disappointed with this purchase, so if you\'re looking to buy one, be careful and know your money will be washed down the drain. We\'ll be buying a simple Black & Decker!.'),

We played with the \"strong\" setting, but it only helped marginally. By the time we had gotten to the fourth or fifth brew we started to get the \"Sorry, there is a problem\" error message on screen. Cleaned the needle as per instructions and we were back in business. Or so I thought. We constantly went back and forth between being able to make either one cup or coffee, or dispense hot water, to error message and repeating cleaning process. Over, and over. What was particularly annoying was that we had used K-Cups for 2.0 and still got error messages, cleaned it frequently and basically had a non-functioning piece of \"counter sculpture\" (which incidentally takes up quite a bit of space) more often than we had a bad tasting coffee maker. No hassle return processed by Amazon allowed us to ship it back.

The only reason it\'s not a 1-star review is because of the jar and lid doubling as a personal cup. That\'s a neat feature. This blender has almost no power. Running for any duration more than pulsing smells like burning plastic. And it won\'t even chafe ice cubes, let alone blend them.

(3625, 9, 1, 5, '2016-03-26', 'Makes a great cup of coffee with minimal clean up I\'ve owned two Cuisanart coffee makers in the past (both Grind & Brews) and this maker is just as good, if not a bit better from a cleaning perspective. Just empty the gold tone filter and wash with warm soapy water and you\'re done. The fact that there isn\'t a carafe is kind of genius. Having owned two Keurigs over the past few years, I grew tired of the K-Cups and really craved a good old-fashioned cup of coffee. You\'re going to get that with this machine. The design is quite beautiful and I love how it lights up your coffee as you pour into your mug. Those familiar with Cuisanart will probably like that the machine has similar features to the other models, including the five gentle beeps it makes after completing the brew cycle. It takes about 7 minutes to brew a full 12 cups. I brew about 2 cups daily and this model is perfect for that. Easy to set the night before, brews quickly, gives off a nice aroma, and clean up is minimal. Regarding commuter mugs: I use the Oxo Good Grips stainless steel mug and it fits under the machine after you remove the drip tray. If you have anything taller, it\'s not going to fit unless you angle the mug under the pour spout. The reviewers who complained about the electric cord being too short don\'t realize that you need to tug firmly when you first remove from the box. The cord is exactly the length stated in the product description. A gentle yank should do the trick. See my photo for reference. Although I do love the minimal parts and effort to clean after using, I would like to see another model like this with the Grind & Brew option. I am a big fan of that model because you don\'t have to use a separate device to grind the beans. But, you go into it knowing you have to clean the grinding chamber and its lid daily (hence why two less parts to clean on this model is attractive, in addition to not cleaning a carafe and lid daily). Overall this is a fantastic machine for those tired of the K-Cups, Nespresso pods, etc., but want a similar machine using \"normal coffee.\"'),

I\'ve read reviews from others about the coffee maker shooting water/coffee all over the place. I have not encountered this at all. Also, I\'ve used k-cups and a medium ground coffee and have had no problems with clogging or with grounds in my coffee cup. I will still keep my 12 cup coffee maker for days when at home or have company, but this single cup brew coffee maker is great when I want only want a single cup of coffee or as I head out to work.

Okay I have had this thing since May of 2014.  It looks nice.  It\'s retro.  It\'s woman and physically challenged people friendly.  I bought this after exhaustive research and stealth in-store testing on coffee makers that don\'t require a lot of arm strength to pour a cup of coffee.  So this thing, you can pour the water in with good arm (in my case left, and I am right-dominant), fill the little filter with coffe,  and when the coffee is ready, VOILA you put the cup under the spigot and press the lever.  I\'ve been really careful about setting the coffee basket like 100% plumb and 100% level like I was setting a door or window.  Well, I got the infamous \"coffee leaks seriously, like big-time, onto countertop\" experience.  Many times.  Despite re-orienting the coffee basket, saying prayers, whatever it took, well, I got coffee all over the place.  Not good.  So when this thing DOES work WITHOUT making a tsunami of brown water on my countertops, the coffee is NOT hot.  Now I don\'t mean this to infer that I want coffee so hot it burns my tongue off and maybe my teeth too.  But coffee hot enough so that when my beloved half -n-half gets poured it, it will last me for a ride down the road for more than 5 minutes before turning into an iced latte.  Oh so let\'s talk about down the road.  I suppose these engineers NEVER thought, well, maybe, perhaps, one day, someone might maybe want to actually TAKE their coffee to work with them!  Lukewarm or not, I don\'t personally know anyone that drives to work using a 6 ounce go-cup.  The issue is - this thing IS NOT TALL ENOUGH to shove a 20 or 24 ounce GO-CUp underneath it, unless you put some 1\" square shims underneath, or just tilt this worthless piece of garbage backward so you can put something bigger than a standard 6 oz coffee cup underneath.  In this day and age when most people actually go to a place to work, they might just wanna bring their coffee with them.  Notwithstanding the mess, the lukewarm tempertature but now I can\'t even get a half-baked cup of Joe to accompany me on my 1.5 hour commute to work without re-engineering the whole kitchen, well, again, you all need to get better user acceptance testing and pay attention to the feedback.  Because you missed the boat, big-time...I dare the engineers to fill a 24 ounce go-cup without modifying the design as it is, or tilting the machine.  Maybe I missed something but I am standing by my observation that this THING needs to be like 2 + inches taller between bottom of cup and the dispenser area so maybe we can all enjoy a cup of coffee that might, and might not, be somewhat palatable and above freezing temperature.  I would not recommend this to anyone.'),

Their only challenge is that the knob to set the timer was a bit hard for them to turn when we first got it--which i think is a combination of the size of the dial and the comparative torque required by smaller hands to turn it.

I didn\'t need anything with a lot of different modes, just a simple blender and that is exactly what this is. I used it quite regularly for almost two years. Then it died with no warning. I turned it on one day and it did nothing at all. I checked a few things but it was clear. My blender bit the dust. I forgot about it for a while then decided i really missed it. I looked around at other brands but this one did everything I wanted and held up fairly well for being inexpensive and used so much so I purchased a second one. That one has been going strong for about eight months. I don\'t know how long it has left in it but even if I have to buy one every couple of years, it\'s not a bad deal. I could get a much more expensive blender that would probably last for ages but I don\'t need that for smoothies and shakes. I like that I can take the cup with me and not have to mess up two cups and it washes up fine. I always wash the cup by hand and dry it then put it right back on the blender for my next use. I wish it had just a bit more capacity though. 20 ounces would be great. But this one gives me enough especially if I am drinking a thick smoothie that is dense and filling. This blender isn\'t great at crushing ice or very hard things but is perfect for fruits, veggies, protein powders, and other  softer or powdered things. I liked it enough that I bought two of them and I am hoping that the one I have now will hold up longer than the first one. I would say, for the price, you really can\'t go wrong unless, of course, the motor poops out really quickly like some of the reviewers here are saying. So far, I haven\'t had that issue although I admit that the motor does seem to just die when it feels like it. Luckily I got enough time out of my first one to make it worth buying a second one.');

First you had to \"defrost\" it.  Then onward with toasting it.  We still had to put it at the highest setting to get anything resembling toast.  But we put up with it.  Yesterday it stopped working altogether. The search resumes. I am not optimistic and I refuse to spend hundreds of dollars on a toaster. How come my mother had the same simple toaster for probably 40 years and it always did its job?'),

I wanted a unit that had a reservoir to fill and not have to fill the pot - then fill the reservoir.  It\'s just more efficient to have to only fill something once, and not twice.  That\'s one reason we got this one. The power cord on this unit is VERY short - like maybe 6-8 inches.  We pulled some more of it out of the base so we could at least plug it in.  The manual says it\'s short so you don\'t trip on it - but at least give a foot or two.  No kidding the cord is less than a foot.  So - if you put it under a cabinet, you may need to unplug it each day so you can open the top and put the coffee in.  You can\'t put a tall mug under the dispenser - so if you have a travel mug you use you\'ll have to fill a regular mug and then pour it into the travel mug (not very efficient).

I found that this machine made a good cup of coffee and was easy to use with the capability to control the coffee strength. I found several good features, but several that I did not like and that these resulted in lowering my rating for the machine. Pros   Ability to control the strength of the coffee and to make cups of 4,6,8 or 10 ounces.  The machine will also brew a 40-ounce pot of coffee, but you need a special carafe that is NOT supplied.  According to the instruction the machine will also make hot chocolate, but I have not tied this.  The machine comes with a charcoal filter to remove water impurities, thereby eliminating a source of variability and poor coffee. Cons   You need special K-cups that are made for especially this machine.  According to Keurig there are other brands of coffee that make compatible cups, but not all cups will work, including those made for earlier model Keurig machines.  (I understand that there are workarounds to defeat this feature of the machine, but I have not yet tried any.  Also, see the comments section for a link to what is purported to be a refillable cup that will work with this model.  However, I have not tried this refillable cup so I cannot vouch for its operation with this model Keurig.)  While the machine makes 4,6,8 or 10 ounce cups of coffee, it is not setup for 12 ounces, which is what I usually brew.  The machine does not come with the carafe that you need for a 40-Oz pot and other carafes will not work even if they physically fit into the machine because the carafe must engage a special interlock mechanism.  While the manufacturer is well within its right to make such a design, I found it to be an obnoxious feature of the machine.  Likewise, for the incompatibility of the k-cups made for earlier models.  The k-cups are not refillable and I understand are not biodegradable, so being plastic will reside in your landfill for an unacceptably long time.  (See the comments section for a third party refillable cup that is purported to work with this model.) The fact that the manufacturer has chosen to prevent the use of older K-cups, refillable K-cups and other manufacturers carafes has led me to down-rate this machine to four-stars.

Seems to work OK so far (one week).  But the one thing that immediately stood out is that I couldn\'t just slide the hot toast off the rack onto my plate.  The rack frame front bar forms a front barrier, requiring me to reach into the oven to grab my (hot OUCH!) toast, or use a fork to stab it to get it out.  This just is NOT right.  Soooo...  I looked at the manual, and, sure enough, the manual shows the front-to-rear rack bars spot welded on TOP of the rack frame front bar, NOT on the bottom.  So IF the frame was built per the manual, no problem to slide the toast out.  If you flip the rack over - wrong elevation.  Go figure.  So I\'m guessing Cuisinart\'s Chinese manufacturing buddies took liberties with the design, probably to make manufacturing easier somehow, and screwed-up the functionality of this product.

I was sent a defective product. The blade on the cup is loose and doesn\'t respond to the portion of the cup that spins the blade from the motor. And no, you can\'t tighten it. So either they sent me a new and dirty defective blender, or they sent me a returned defective blender without cleaning or making sure it works. And it\'ll probably cost me more to return the product than to just buy a new one. This is why I stick to Ninjas. **update** I got my new Blender. It works decent for $15.

I\'m only giving it a one-star review because there are a kabillion reviews and if I were reading reviews I would look at the crappy reviews first to see what is wrong with the product.  I don\'t need more \"Great product!\" reviews. So here is what is wrong with the coffeemaker, like everybody else says (and I didn\'t read) the front face-plate practically jumps off as soon as you unpack it, along with a shower of crumbly plastic bits.  That said, a genius invented this machine, it has a removable water reservoir that and an front-load basket.  As if it were designed for humans.  My friend has a CuisineArt and you have to pour the water in this tiny slot at the top of the coffeemaker.  You have to pour slowly in order not to spill so it\'s like you turn into Rip Van Winkle before you get your Joe, your baby child becomes a grandfather as you are pouring this tiny stream of water into a tiny hole.  Not to mention I\'m groggy in the morning. I thought about getting the Mokkamaster, it looks great, but those Dutch Coffee-overlords won\'t put a simple timer on their machine for fear of ruining the purity of their product.  Maybe they have laws against it, you get 10 years of paternity leave but you have to wait for the coffee to brew in the morning.  I am just non-functional then, if a robber came I would just ask him to take my goods quietly. So the only problem I had  with the Hamilton Beach was with the front bezel.  And to tell the truth the front-plate is no prize.  it\'s brushed plastic and looks \"el cheapo\".  I did not want to glue it back in.  So instead I took epoxy putty and filled in the hollows.  Stuck a couple of metal decorations on it, and now I have a nice more steampunk-looking coffeemaker!

In all my years of owning coffee makers, some of which lasted for twenty years, I have never had this happen. Hamilton Beach\'s warranty seems designed to minimize the return of defective products with onerous requirements and high shipping costs. I opted to spray paint the hotplate with Rust-Oleum high heat spray paint. I can do this a number of times at considerably less expense and hassle than trying to obtain a replacement under the Hamilton Beach warranty.

Because I have 4 middle to high school age kids banging on it, I don\'t want to buy a new oven when it still works (or at least works as well as it ever has). The kids have tried using this to warm microwave pizzas and stuff like that, but it\'s very inconsistent in how hot it gets. Especially if someone else already used it and it\'s still slightly warm. This is not a great appliance. I would happily replace if it fit into our budget and could see from the first time I used it that we got exactly what we paid for. Really, this is no bargain.'),

I love all the settings on this toaster, and I have used all of them. This toasts evenly and consistently on both sides. The down side, however, is its very hard to clean it out. There are crumb trays that slide out, but crumbs and other debris get stuck in other areas and you have to shake the toaster upside down to get everything out. It proved durable for many years, until one of my kids stick a twist tie in the toaster and turned it on, shorting out the elements in one side of the toaster so it no longer works.

I\'ve always had great experiences with Cuisinart products which is what led to my purchase of a TOB-40 toaster over.  I was attracted to this model due to the great company reputation and warranty.  This unit was replaced under warranty in Oct 2014 due to a faulty heating element.  Cuisinart was great about replacing it as long as I paid shipping for the replacement unit as well as shipping back to them for my broken unit.  I still figured this was better than purchasing a completely new unit.  If you do some searches on the web, the faulty heating element seems to be a known issue.  Some people have also reported this to the Consumer Products Safety Commission as this could be a fire hazard and were hoping for a recall. My replacement unit worked great until just the other day. After using the oven to toast waffles for my kids, the toaster was turned off and out of the blue the glass completely shattered and exploded.  Thankfully, my kids were not near the unit as they could have been injured as a result of this explosion.  I\'ve included a picture of the unit post explosion for you to see.  I called customer service and spoke to a rep who basically said that since the warranty was tied to my original unit and that transferred to the replacement unit (which has now expired) there was nothing that they could do on this defective 4 month old unit.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and spoke with Shelby who gave me the same answer that there was nothing that could be done.  I could understand if my unit just stopped working after an extended period of time.  But this is a serious issue on a relatively new unit that could have resulted in serious injury. I\'m very disappointed in the customer service and policy that is in place by Cuisinart.  I would have hoped that keeping a loyal customer happy would be more important to them instead of worry about saving the money on a product that costs them less than $100 to replace.  You\'ve now lost a customer for life and I strongly urge anyone interested in purchasing their products to think twice.'),

Today I see I never reviewed it, so I shall now.  This unit is terribly hard to keep clean and I am in ongoing e-mail conversations with Cuisinart about this fact.  The black plastic, interior unit (the \"coffee holder\") has so many nooks and crannies, you can never get it satisfactorily clean. Based on the manual I was running the half water/half vinegar self clean cycle once a month since August.  In between self clean cycles, I would also wipe the interior with \"warm, soapy water\" (again, the manual) every so often to clean it. I thought this was satisfactory until 4 days ago.  Our morning coffees had \"floaties\".  I dumped the coffee and began to inspect the interior while over the sink.  I began to see all the areas I really could not reach.  What I could reach, I found massive coffee residue build up.  I began to tackle the interior with warm, soapy water and scrubbing the best I could, using rags, dish brushes, and even an old toothbrush.  This was producing massive black flaking.  I then let white vinegar soak in the reservoir. Rinsing, I found more and more black flaking flowing into the sink with every dump of water through the black reservoir.  Now it never stops.  I have created a monster.  Every towel I use to wipe and dry to view my progress, comes away black as soot.  My wife is now \'grossed out\' and will not drink from the DCC-3000 any longer. I never dreamed this DCC-3000 would be so difficult to keep clean, even following a good cleaning regime previously.  Why does the \'self clean\' cycle not really clean the unit?  Why am I having to roll up the sleeves and really scrub?  And with an old toothbrush?  It\'s only been 5 months of ownership.  It shouldn\'t be this difficult. Edit, January 27, 2016: Since writing this, Cuisinart has suggested that using only vinegar and water while utilizing the unit\'s self-clean cycle may not be enough to keep the DCC-3000 clean.  I am now being told that to truly clean the interior to utilize a product like CleanCaff for the coffee residue.  I wish when I had asked how best to keep clean 5 months ago, this advice had been given back then.  Instead for now, Cuisinart is going to replace this unit with another DCC-3000 for my troubles, even though nothing is technically wrong with the unit.  I thought that was a nice act.

I decided to try it today and surprisingly the coffee maker blew up after about 45 minutes. What they don\'t tell you is that acetic acid plus calcium carbonate release CO2 gas which is explosive especially when heated under pressure as instructed.

It\'s starting to get cold at night and I wanted something to keep my already made tea hot. I tried the little mug warmers they sell that you plug in, but they don\'t keep my drink as hot as I would like it. I love my Hot Shot water boiler but it only made the hot water, and does not keep my tea hot. I looked, and looked, and thought and brain-stormed.  Ta-da...THIS! I can run hot water through the machine, into the carafe, and have hot water all day/night until I turn it off. I can make my tea (or instant oatmeal, instant hot chocolate, 3 in 1 coffee packets, from this hot water.  OR.... I can use my own glass teapot infuser on the bottom, let the hot water pour into the infuser through the tea/tisane I have in the filter and make my tea and keep it piping hot as I drink it. (I use one like this that I bought on e-bay: )  OR... I can heat the water into the B&D carafe, pour it into a teapot to infuse, then pour it back into the B&D carafe to keep it hot (if the infuser doesn\'t fit the machine). I LOVE that the switch (on/off) is on the right side and also the water fill gauge on the right as I\'m disabled (severe RA in most joints)  and in bed a lot so this sits right on my lower nightstand (make-shift) tea bar. When I wake up in the morning I have my hot tea before getting out of bed. I can see that the coffee maker is on by the glowing red light on the switch so I can turn it off when done. I don\'t have to call out for someone to make me a hot drink (bothering them) and I feel good about being able to do this myself (feeling of accomplishment). I can also make my evening tisanes/herbals the same way without any help. I keep 3 - 24 ounce bottles of water with me so I can drink to my heart\'s content all day and evening without getting up. The teas and tisanes keep me from munching out of boredom so this in-turn is healthy for me. Some teas I add a touch of sugar (kept in a small mason jar with lid) and a Mini-Moo (half and half) for richness (especially on the masala chai) but mainly I drink them plain. No matter how I\'m drinking it, this machine keeps the tea nice and hot. I mainly use the B&D carafe for keeping hot water so in the morning I can make a miso soup, then instant oatmeal, then a small pot of tea. I use my own small teapots for keeping my made tea hot until it\'s finished...the hotplate keeps it very hot. I accidentally ordered 2 (didn\'t notice until they arrived) and after using one I decided to keep the other in case this one breaks. At twelve dollars and some change I couldn\'t go wrong with trying this to see if it would meet my needs...it does and it does it well. I am pleased. ETA: This isn\'t a coffee maker that you can pull out the carafe and the coffee will stop pouring out - it\'s a continuous drip through the filter into the carafe.  This is exactly what I wanted for making tea, I wanted the water to keep flowing into different sized teapots/mugs and not have to rely on only having to use their carafe. ETA: This is AWESOME! I had leftover tea from the night before and reheated it on the keep warm plate -- the tea got piping hot within an hour and I\'m enjoying the rest of the tea.'),

In addition, the toaster gives off a terrible burning plastic smell while it\'s on. Strong enough to fill my (small) apartment for 15 minutes. Also, a design issue: the round knobs look nice but there is no grippiness on them and they\'re perfectly round. You have to turn the toast timer dial past 10 minutes and then back to shorter time to toast (like most toasters), but because the knob is smooth and round, it\'s difficult to turn the knob back. Another design issue: there\'s no governor to stop the door, so when you open it then slide your fingers off, the handle smacks into the countertop. The only way to stop it would be to grab the glass part of the door and gently ease it onto the counter, but the glass is dangerously hot once the toaster has been on, so there\'s no way to stop the slam. Can\'t imagine that would be good for the structural integrity of the door over time. Sent it back immediately.'),

I called customer service and was able to talk to a representative very quickly.  After going through a few steps to try to resolve the problem, the CSR said they would send out a new upgraded brewing system.  In less than a week I had a new system.  I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Keurig\'s customer service.  Since no one else in my household drinks coffee, I love being able to make a single cup rather than a whole pot.  I also use it to make ice tea which is excellent.  I have not made a whole pot of coffee yet, but it is nice to know that I have that capability.  I think the pods are a little expensive, but I do not waste any coffee by making whole pot and then throwing most of it away.Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.'),

While I liked the idea of a lift-out water container, I was concerned that the water might leak through the seal;  not a problem!!!  Have had it for almost  a year and its hasn\'t leaked a drop!  Love the convenience of the water container.  The little wheels on the bottom allow you to easily move the coffee maker around on the counter even while the coffee is brewing.  I also use it to heat water for tea and, unless I use a highly aromatic coffee, I get no coffee taste in my tea water even if I just rinse the pot and the coffee basket with water.

(3949, 5, 1, 5, '2014-02-07', 'I\'m Pleasently Surprised I\'ve owned nothing but Krups coffee makers for the last 20 years and have become distressed at their decline in quality.  My original Krups lasted 12 years, but the newer ones last a couple years at most.  My current one was on it\'s last legs, and we were having all kinds of problems with it.  A $90.00 coffee maker should really work well and last a long time.  I did a lot of research on the best coffee makers & brewstations, and there were so many negative comments it was unbelievable.  Consumer Reports tested a lot of brewers and listed Mr. Coffee as one of their top picks.  Give me a break. I\'ve been there.  Mr. Coffee\'s don\'t produce pleasant coffee.  The Cuisinarts have serious mechanical problems & I called their customer service line to find out what they were doing to solve the broken latch problem on the lid and their answer to me was \"Don\'t worry about that.  If it breaks, we\'ll send you another unit.\"  I pointed out all the negative reviews to him & his response wasn\'t \"we\'re in process of fixing it,\" it was \"Those people don\'t know how to use our coffee maker.\"  I discovered those top-end makers that cost $200-500.00 that are the only 2 that are certified by some American coffee institute, but really, $200.00 for a coffee maker that\'s hand made by Norwegians that only has an on/off switch, no clock, no programmable features.  No way!  Did you know you can buy a Melitta filter cone for $5.00 that sits on top of  any pot or mug, that you pour boiling water into & presto, you\'ll have one of the best tasting cups of coffee you\'ve ever had.  But it doesn\'t have automatic controls, except for you & me - we\'re the controls. So I saw this Hamilton Beach maker with a high star rating, read the reviews ( yes, all of them), and for $45.00 I was willing to give it a try, though not expecting wonders.  I am impressed!  This is a well-engineered unit, from the nifty wheels below the base to allow you to rotate it to pull off the water reservoir, to the button controlled grounds basket popping out sideways, to the adjustable temperature warming plate, to the selectable brew strength, to the unique rim of the pot that makes it just about impossible to drip.  But all those are secondary to what everyone wants - good tasting coffee.  My son, who is a Starbucks fan and quite picky about coffee flavor, tasted my first pot of coffee and said \"Wow, this is good!\"  It is good.  It\'s not the best coffee I\'ve ever had, but it is very, very good - better than my Krups made by far.  Yes, and for only $45.00.  So no Norwegian craftsmen needed in this house. One word of warning.  I saw this unit had free shipping - cool!  I wanted to buy the permanent gold-toned filter also and I saw part way down the Amazon order page that for a small amount extra, I could get the maker & the cone together.  Ok, that\'s what I clicked on.  Guess what - when you click that link you\'ll pay $17.00 for shipping that you\'d save if you ordered the parts separately.  Really, Amazon, do you have to resort to tricking your customers that way?  I feel screwed.  Yes I should have read the invoice more carefully, but I do feel like Amazon screwed me.  Not good customer service, guys. Ok, here\'s an update after about 3 weeks of use.  I love it, love it, love it!  It\'s inexpensive, has plenty of extras, coffee is great tasting, and I would advise using the  brew strength setting of 1-4 cups for optimal flavor.  This product is superb!  Some have complained about the lit display being too bright.  Think dim nite light. I don\'t sleep in my kitchen & I sure don\'t know anyone who does.  The one thing about Krups machines that bugged me every day was how hard it was for a visually deficient \'ol codger like me to read what the current settings were on the display.  The Hamilton Beach lit display is big, crisp, and illuminated, perfect for my dim eyes.  Because the basket is one of those flat-bottomed types, it\'s not as efficient as the cones in extracting coffee flavor.  You\'ll need to use about 50% more grounds than with a cone-shaped filter.  I found that 1/2 cup grounds to 8 cups water was perfect for my taste buds.'),

I was so excited to receive this and begin using it, followed the start up instructions, cleaned the tank, soaked the filter and when I was ready to plug it in, I was flabbergasted.  The cord, as you can see by the attached photo is about 2 1/2 inches in length from coffee maker to outlet.  I thought it was a power cord that extended to the desired length, but when it wasn\'t budging, I searched the product guide and found \"Special Cord Set Instruction\", which reads \"A short power-supply cord is provided to reduce the risks resulting from becoming entangled in or tripping over a longer cord.  Extension cords may be used if care is exercised in their use.\"  This is quite possibly the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen as if it is so much safer to use an extension cord???  I refuse to attach an extension cord to a beautiful coffee maker in my beautiful kitchen due to their product misfit design.  So with that said, I didn\'t actually get to use the product, so I cannot comment on the coffee that it makes, but the design is worth giving this product a 1.

It still gets the coffee hotter than other coffee makers I\'ve had, so the flavor turns out better versus past coffee makers. Brew time depends on the starting water temperature but it also brews faster than other makers I\'ve had which likely relates to the higher brew temperature. The blue display has a nice look without being too bright since only the digits are lit against a dark blue background. I bought it mainly for the swing out filter basket and removable water bin to make it easier to use without moving out from under the cabinet overhang. The narrow width also maximizes counter space. It has the typical timer as well as a brew strength control which pauses the water addition to give more extraction time but note that doesn\'t result in hotter water.The adjustable hot plate temperature keeps the coffee from burning before returning for refills as well.'),

This should have been worked out before placing this system in retail stores for public purchase.  On the positive side, it does brew nicely after having to wait for it to warm up in a rather noisy fashion.  We are an office of all females who really aren\'t inclined to be patient when caffeine is desperately needed!  Most other functions are easy to use and the carafe feature is a nice addition.

(4053, 5, 1, 5, '2015-03-21', 'If my last maker was Mr. Coffee... this is Dr. Coffee. I was impressed enough to buy two more. My favorite coffee maker so far. I\'m reluctant to be over-enthusiastic about a new purchase, because the a product\'s true quality shows over time. I\'m tired of feeling like coffee makers are disposable, but I\'m also not convinced that any coffee maker is worth $100 or more (except for makes like Bunn\'s commercial models). So... enter the sub-$50 price-bracket. The average \"standard\" coffee maker with a clock and timer is about $30. What does an extra $10-15 get you with the Hamilton Beach 46201? With the help of another reviewer, I see that cheaper makers sometimes utilize cheaper thermostat systems. The same high-heat that makes the water hot enough to extract coffee from the beans, also controls the temperature of the burner. The reviewer suggested this was a source of bitterness because the coffee at the bottom of the pot is burning. *shrug* I don\'t know about the science of thermodynamics, but I do know that coffee is tasting great out of this new pot I\'m reviewing here! The obvious benefits of this maker are the removable water tank (\"reservoir\" is too hard to spell)... the water tank is pretty cool. I didn\'t think I\'d be filling the maker by removing the tank, but as it turns out after a week of using it... this is what I do naturally. There is a nice lip which accommodates your grip easily, and after filling the tank by first filling the pot, and pouring in... I\'ve decided it\'s easiest to simply fill the maker as the designer\'s intended. If you have trouble accepting this and just want to flip open the lid and pour water in from the pot as you always have... well, it\'s MUCH easier to do that with this maker also! The tank lid flips open allowing a wide-open, unobstructed pour. My previous Mr. Coffee maker has a stupidly designed, complicated plastic grate that you have to pour water through... so I\'m doing a bit of a marksman pour... actually having to THINK about how I\'m pouring water into the maker (in the tired, wee-hours of the morning)... THIS maker... ends all that. I like the swing-out filter basket... and I really like STANDARD FILTERS! I went through the cone filter phase... nope, never again. I just never tasted the benefit. The filters cost more, and you have to sort of \"prep\" each filter that you use... whereas the normal filters fall in place effortlessly. I realize we\'re not talking about actual work here either way... but if there\'s no appreciable benefit to something that costs a little more and requires a little more effort... I\'ll take cheap, good, and easy... thank you very much. NO DRIP POT! The first time you pour a cup from this pot I guarantee you\'ll grin... Holy Smokes... why in the heck don\'t all manufacturers at least try to steal this no-drip pot design? The little bar of plastic that goes across the spout combines with the spout shape to make a perfect pour, every time. Hey Hamilton Beach! Do you want me to make a great commercial for this maker? I have lots of ideas :-) I also like the little wheels on the bottom of the maker. The Mr. Coffee maker this one is replacing had rubber \"no-slide\" feet. WHO leaves their maker tucked away so that it steams up the bottom of your wood cabinets? Nope, you pull it out a bit... the thing NEEDS to slide around. Hamilton Beach (or the designer of this maker) deserves a pat on the back for that little detail. The buttons stick out a bit, which I like more than the flush-buttons that seemed more of a style choice on my last maker. There\'s a positive \"tactile\" feel to them, not effort to push, but a satisfying \"click\" response. I\'ve had other makers with buttons that don\'t always react, or I had to push a specific part of the button. This is simple, and functional. I like things that simply work. The clock display is great. I prefer an LED where the numbers are lit vs. the background being lit. In normal household lighting, the clock is EASY to read. This is great for people of all ages. Also... notice the clock and all controls are at the TOP... vs the bottom of the maker, or running down one side. I\'m not usually a fan of extended warranties, but with my past-experience with Mr. Coffee (see my other reviews, I loved my last Mr. Coffee maker so much that I bought one for my Mom... Well... her\'s crapped out in about 3 months... and mine became \"problematic\" in roughly 9 months... so EXTENDED WARRANTY HERE I COME!)... Anyway, Canopy Warranty offered by Amazon was only $4. I\'m sure there will be a little BS involved if I ever make a claim, but here\'s hoping it goes well. I\'m hoping I never need the warranty, but for $4 I like the peace of mind. Here\'s the important point about this maker vs. the Mr. Coffee maker, which I was also enthusiastic about when I first got it... so much so, that I bought one for my Mom too. If that last maker was Mr. Coffee... THIS maker is Dr. Coffee. This make is so well-designed... so well thought-out... that I really WANT it to last 3 years! Mostly, I hope Hamilton Beach continues to offer a maker like this... at an \"every-man\" price. Asking roughly 25% more for a maker that\'s 100% better? That\'s easy money... I will gladly pay a little more for anything SMART. After 3 days of using this maker... I was so impressed with the design features that I bought two more, one for my Mom and one for my brother... both with the extended warranty. For the next 3 years we have a nice little product test pool going :-)'),

A machine I was skeptical of from the start. This seemed like a trap. Like when an app you love has an \"update\", only to later find out they merely added ads and took away previously-free features. That\'s Keurig 2.0! PROS: - The motor doesn\'t make that horrid grinding sound that would wake the whole house each morning for every cup of coffee. This is almost entirely silent. - Range of sizes. We don\'t need carafes, just single cups. Maybe 3-4 a day. And sometimes hot water for cooking. - Fast warm-up and brew times. CONS: -Water bin location. It\'s on the back now, and the lid is shaped like a horseshoe. A bit wonky. -The k-cup monopoly conspiracy! This hateful machine only fancies \"Keurig brand\" k-cups. Not those \"Keurig compatible\" wannabes. Which I was unaware we even had until this thing started rejecting cups from our bin. And it doesn\'t like double-brewing a single k-cup. (Which you can trick it into doing by rotating the cup.) These are two things the original Keurig did without fail. It wasn\'t a feature, it was common sense. I should be able to use any Keurig-friendly cup as many times as I damn well please. But nope, Keurig 2.0 will have none of your funny business! One day, after rejecting the very last k-cup of my favorite tea, this thing almost went into the trash. Fortunately (?) I discovered for less than $10 I can buy a wee metal clip that somehow forces the brewer into using any k-cup again - SOMETHING IT SHOULD HAVE DONE BY DEFAULT.

Before we tried to program it for the next day, we had made our morning pot and it made a good cup of coffee.While we weren\'t expecting lightning speed, it was a little slow to fill the pot, but tasted great. Living on a small island in Alaska, makes sending this back more work than its worth, so I don\'t know what we will be doing.

I have never owned a single cup brew system until this one, so I don\'t have anything to compare it to except our full pot Cusinart.  It was super-simple to set up.  From the time I opened the box until I had my first cup brewed was probably 10 minutes.  It brews \"oilier\" coffee than our Cusinart, and perhaps that\'s a good thing.  We were on vacation in Seattle and took a coffee tour and it was discussed how you can see the oils from the coffee bean at the surface of some coffees. I would be very interested in trying some flavored coffee in this brewer, since that\'s what I\'m used to drinking.  It came with some regular coffee blends - like dark roast or breakfast blend.  I\'d also like to try the hot chocolate and other specialty drinks. I\'m not sure it brews the actual amount you ask it to.  When I ask for 10 ounces, it seems like a very small amount, but I\'d have to measure to be certain.  I wish you could have it fill a travel mug without having to run it for 10 ounces and again for 6 or whatever.  You end up with watered down coffee or using 2 K-cups. I did have a problem with it one of the first days I used it.  It basically wouldn\'t drain the water from the Kcup, so when I opened the top, there was a huge mess of coffee water & grounds that I had to clean up.  I also had to run a hot water cycle to clean out the cup area so I wouldn\'t end up with a mouthful of grounds like I did that morning.  However, this seems to have been a fluke and it\'s been working fine ever since! Overall I\'d recommend this brewer for it\'s ease of use and for someone like myself who rarely drinks more than a cup or two of coffee per day.  The touch-screen feature makes it feel fancy and it has a sleek overall design. I received this product free for testing.'),

I was meaning to purchase one for awhile now and so glad that I was able to get my hands on one now! This is such a convenient machine, especially for my husband and I who can get by sharing a cup of coffee a day. We definitely don\'t need a whole pot of coffee and this allows us to easily make just a cup whenever we want without excess.  I love that it brews so quickly and is available in multiple sizes suited to your needs (4,6,8, 10) and it\'s nice to have the option of getting carafe for it if we decide we want to be able to brew a larger amount. It\'s also nice to have the \"strong\" option for brewing and I really love that I can now make a variety of hot beverages, including tea in this machine and use the \"hot water\" option for other hot water needs! I do wish that it had the capability to brew a little hotter but for the convenience and all the other benefits it comes with, I don\'t mind that too much.

(4123, 9, 1, 5, '2016-10-03', 'Pretty simple specification to meet The coffee is definitely made hot enough to properly extract all the flavor from the beans.  Does not take a large amount of beans to make a full pot of coffee.  I bought this specific model because it does not have a carafe (pot) and it has a timer.  These are glass and tend to break in my household.  Pretty simple specification to meet. As far as making coffee, cleaning and overall operation, I am almost completely satisfied.  Easy to fill and start coffee, all the parts come out for easy cleaning and the machine makes a hot pot of coffee pretty quickly (about 7-8 minutes).  The overflow catch under the spout catches not only coffee drips from the spout but any overfill from making coffee.  This really only happens when you put too many grounds in and if you open the lid when its hot, the condensation will drip to the catch.  My only issues with operation are the filter in the water and the gauge.  The filter isn\'t placed low enough where it actually filters any water and the gauge doesn\'t actually really drop until the third cup.  Not a big deal and not bad enough to drop my review from five stars.  It holds four cups of coffee and my water is plenty filtered already. The permanent filter would be better if it were a cone, but the spray function is one of the best I have seen and provides plenty of coverage to thoroughly soak the grounds.  The unit is not a thermal unit, is does have a hot plate.  I go through coffee fast enough where this does not matter, but your coffee will be burnt after an hour. Pros: Easy to use and clean Makes great coffee without a ton of beans Makes a quick pot of coffee Timer is excellent 1-4 cup option for better coffee Looks great on your counter Cons Gauge is useless Hotplate vs thermal Water filter in holding tank is also useless Overall, this coffee pot is perfect for my wife and I.  We do not make top of the line, specialty coffee but also don\'t just go for the cheapest option.'),

We had a previous model of this toaster, but needed to replace it after one of the heating rods seemed to split open. Since we had liked that toaster, as well as all our other Cuisinart products, we ordered this newer version. Our household wakes up at different times for work, so its important to try and be as quiet as possible.  The timer for the toast setting on this unite has a flaw -- it doesn\'t reset itself after each use if stopped before beeping.  For example: if you set the timer to medium, but you turn off the toaster before the *5* high pitch beeps go off, the next person who uses the toast function will have the timer and the toaster turn itself off too early.  That\'s because the unit is completing the remaining time for the last person.  The only way to prevent the timer from beeping (5 times) and the toaster turning itself off is to unplug the unit after each use of the toast function.  Actually I also unplug it before making toast just in case the last person forgot.  Hopefully this explanation makes sense. I called this problem into the company right after getting the toaster since this had not been an issue with the previous Cuisinart unit.  But it wouldn\'t be a surprise if future units have the same issue because the representative I talked with claimed to not know if this was a problem just with my toaster or it it was a problem for the model.  They were far from interested in taking any useful information I wanted to give so this issue could be fixed in the future.

Lo and behold the same thing is happening to my current oven after about 18 months, one of the lower elements has warped and now touches the bottom of the oven and makes the removal of the crumb try virtually impossible.

I like to arrive downstairs and be greeted by a full, hot pot of coffee every morning, and the only way that\'s going to happen is to have a drip unit.   I figured that there was no point in overspending on one,  and went about researching lower cost units.  Mr. Coffee seems to lead the pack on these, loved by Consumer Reports, but reviews complain of a water filter that must be positioned ever-so-delicately in the unit every time you\'re making a pot.  The Hamilton Beach had no such complaints, and cost-wise is right where I\'m OK if the unit turns out to be disposable in 18 months.   I\'m very pleased with this coffee maker.  The water reservoir pops right out for easy filling (don\'t have to try and pour into it while ducking under the wall cabinets), the basket for your grounds pivots out forward of the unit (no way for grounds to end up in the reservoir, if you\'re being uncoordinated), and programming it was simple and intuitive.  It takes about 10 minutes to make a full pot, and the coffee is as hot and strong as what my Cuisinarts produced.   Coming out of the box,  the unit feels pretty lightweight, but not flimsy. Maybe it\'ll die in 18 months, who knows? For now, it works well and is easy to use, and it\'s far less messy than that percolator.  At this price, I\'d buy another just to keep in reserve,  but we\'ll wait and see. **Update 3/30/15 - Arrived this morning to a coffeemaker that had crapped out. No heat, no coffee, just a light on.

I was rather intrigued when I saw this coffee maker had a removable water tank.  Cleaning the water tank had been a pain in the past but this removable tank makes it so much easier. This coffee maker is pretty smart. If the water tank is not latched on properly, it won\'t brew.  When it happened first, I thought it was broken already.  But I soon noticed that the top of the water tank was not quite leveled.  All I had to do was push the tank and restart the machine. This coffee maker has different options for the temperature and the strength of your coffee.  Though it has a \"1 - 4 Cups\" brew setting, I recommend using \"Bold\" if you prefer stronger and richer flavor regardless of the amount of the coffee. The only problem was the glass carafe.  The lid didn\'t snap on tightly so every time I pour the last couple of cups, it would swing open and the hot steam would come out.  When I used it for the first time, I had the high temperature setting.  So it almost burned my hand.  I lowered the temperature and held the lid with a pot holder since. However, its carafe was flimsy. One morning when I tried to clean the carafe, I tapped it on my Quartz countertop accidentally.  Not hard at all.  But it was enough to break the carafe.  I searched and searched for the replacement.  There were replacements on Amazon, but the reviews weren\'t great.  When I went on to Hamilton Beach website, the carafes were out of stock (surprise!).  So I decided to try Cuisinart carafe instead.  I had used one of their coffee makers before and their carafe never broke.  Thankfully it fits and has been working great.  Cuisinart updated their lid to snap on instead of swing open.  So it stays tightly even when I pour my last cup.  The picture shown here is with the Cuisinart carafe. And here is the link to the Cuisinart carafe sale. http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CFNE3?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00 If Hamilton Beach made their carafes sturdier like Cusinart, I would give it a 5-star.'),

It does make good coffee and the features are still great....but...in swinging out the filter basket sometimes brushes against the plate covering the control panel and the last time it did this that plate fell offf.  After investigation I discovered that the screws holding the plate on had broken out, so now the plate keeps falling off when the filter swings out.

I do make sure to put the juice (or whatever liquid you are using) in the cup first to make the blending easier. I was hesitant to buy because it was so inexpensive but for $15 if it only lasts me a year I have no problem buying another one. The only thing I have annoying is that it only comes with 1 cup and I can\'t seem to find a way to purchase just a cup.'),

I cannot begin to tell you the extent of the toaster and toaster oven related drama I have been living with for the past seventeen years. My daughter is fond of toast, but she is not fond of the toaster. My husband and I would often wake up to screaming to find our daughter curled up behind the refrigerator, sobbing. When we asked her what was wrong, she would whimper and point to the half-burnt, half-limp bread protruding from our toaster. As she became a teenager, we would get in shouting matches over the bagel setting, and I had to drive down to the police station more than once to pick up my daughter after a night of toaster vandalism. My son, on the other hand, adored the toaster. He cried for weeks after our old model bit the dust, and even requested we hold a funeral for our faithful little appliance. Needless to say, when the topic of buying a new toaster oven came up in one of our weekly family meetings, he was devastated. For weeks, my children fought over which new appliance we would add to our home, and there was hardly a moment of the piece. Thats when my husband found the Hamilton Beach 22703 Ensemble Toastation Toaster Over, a miracle device that is both toaster and toaster oven. Since its addition to our home, the fighting and violent outbursts from both of my children have stopped and our home is peaceful once again. I even found that theyve taken to toasting their bread together. I will forever be indebted to Hamilton Beach for making my house a home once again. Oh, and it also toasts sandwiches.'),

The water reservoir is very cool and fits under my refrigerator filtered water tap. One thing...when you are breaking the machine in...do not forget to empty the carafe after the first...second and maybe, third pot of rinse water.

I just happened to walk through the kitchen on my way to bed later that night and found the toast oven was still on. ...and not just on, on full power and blazing hot even on the outside. Turning the power switch on and off did nothing. It had to be unplugged to shut it off, It had super-heated the cabinet above it and no doubt had I not noticed it, we would have awoken to a smoke alarm and our kitchen engulfed in flames.

It looks like the plastic on the inside of the cover is broken so it can\'t just be snapped back into place.

Additionally,  this model does not come with a safety feature to prevent brewing if the pot is not where it should be.

Yes, it\'s plastic and not high end looking like stainless is, but this little toaster does the job and does it well.  Quickly toasts bread (way faster than a toaster oven) and it\'s consistent as far as being browned on both sides.  I like that the handle pushes up so you can grab your toast without burning your fingers.  I also like the bagel setting.  You push that button when you start toasting and it only browns the cut side so the rounded side stays soft but nice and hot.  I\'ve also used the reheat function.

I understand that the timer/ding and multiple knobs are probably due to safety features implemented in those 20 years, but it seems overly complicated to use. Another probably safety-related change that I don\'t like is that the rack is a lot higher up inside this model, so I can no longer fit a standard loaf pan inside. (I bought a shallower pan for baking cornbread, etc.) And the trays that fit inside the old model are about 1/4 inch too wide to go into this oven -- you can kind of force them in but they don\'t really sit level. Mostly I guess I just miss my old toaster oven! They definitely don\'t make small appliances like that any more. This one looks nice but I guarantee it won\'t last 20 years.'),

The first cup of the day is often gotten in a dark kitchen, so I really liked the light that comes when dispensing coffee. All subsequent brews were disastrous. The valve/gasket that opens to dispense coffee didn\'t close fully, so the second pot of coffee brewed all over the kitchen counter and onto the floor. I fiddled with it to make sure there wasn\'t a blockage, but all subsequent uses resulted in leaks. I followed the instructions for use exactly to make sure it wasn\'t anything I was doing wrong. Each time I brewed coffee I returned the coffee maker and obtained a replacement, and that one did the same thing. Even IF the thing didn\'t leak everywhere, this still would not be the coffee maker for me; the instructions say to use 1 spoonful (spoon included) of coffee per cup, using no more than 14 spoonfuls.

I looked at hot water kettles but the reviews of those had drawbacks from flimsy construction to rusting. So I bought and tried this. It works great with instant coffee and it is very low cost. Just put the instant coffee in the plastic filter basket with NO PAPER FILTER. The coffee maker has a shower head type water sprayer that sprays hot water into the filter basket. This effectively and thoroughly dissolves the coffee and when it goes into the carafe it is ready to drink. I actually place a big mug under the spout instead of the included carafe and I don\'t have to even pour. I place a large 20oz mug under the spout. I pour water into the coffee maker to the 3.5 cup level. In a short while the cup is full and the coffee is actually darker and stronger than it would be if I just put the coffee in hot water and stirred. The one packet is supposed to make one cup (5 to 8 oz) but I use the one pack to make about 16oz. The coffee is dark and strong enough for me.

I\'m not sure there\'s truly such a thing as a toaster that toasts bread completely evenly.  Certainly not in the (affordable) price range that we\'re interested in purchasing.  It does a decent enough job; it\'s only toast, this is not Cordon Bleu cooking.  While the unit works reasonably well, it does have some challenges.  If you\'re a bit older, you might find all the markings on the three function dials a bit hard to read.  In fact, it is kind of annoying to have to spin all the dials for each use when you are changing from \"toast,\" to \"bake,\" to even just \"warm.\"  Too much messing around to get the function you want.  And then, of course, you\'ll need to keep your glasses handy to read the very small black-on-silver writing or symbols that indicate what it is you are choosing to accomplish with this toaster-oven.  The one significant problem with this unit is that the bottom selection dial requires you to spin it completely past the 10-minute mark and then have to turn it again back counter-clockwise to get to the color of toast you want.  This dial turns easily enough in the clockwise direction.  But in counter-clockwise direction (which you MUST use to get back to the desired toast color), this dial is extremely hard to grip and turn.  My wife needs to get out the rubber dishwashing gloves in order to grip this dial well enough to turn it counter-clockwise.  Even for me it is a difficult grip and turn.  I will probably install something sticky or grippy to be able to get this function dial to turn more easily going counter-clockwise.  So...in order to make toast you have to set 3 dials--which seems a bit excessive.  On our old Black and Decker, the toast color was permanently set, and all you needed to do was hit the start button.  Also on the old one, if you wanted to bake, all you did was turn the separate oven temperature dial.  You didn\'t have to reset all these functions like you do on this one.  It\'s just annoying, that\'s all.  It does make very good bake potatoes.  Our old Black and Decker quit after about 12 years, so we\'ll see how this one does.  It\'s OK...but not great.'),

Bought this last March after my latest expensive Cuisinart machine decided it had worked long enough. It is very well designed and made.  Being able to easily separate the reservoir and fill it at the sink is a refreshing change from having to use a flashlight to see how much water I needed to pour into the Cuisinart.  Also very easy to take basket out to clean.  Carafe is good about not making a mess when you take it out in mid cycle.  The only, very minor, gripe I have is that there is a lip at the top of the carafe that makes it a little less easy to clean it out after use. Notwithstanding, this is easily the best coffee maker I\'ve had vs. much more expensive and less intuitive units from Krups, Braun and Cuisinart.

I like my coffee with a kick, and that feature certainly delivers; I found it especially better in comparison to my older Keurig\'s performance. For those who like iced coffee, I also found the strong brew feature helpful for brewing what I\'ve dubbed \"lazy iced coffee.\" I just brew a cup over ice on the strong setting and the coffee comes out really nice - it\'s iced without that watered down taste that usually accompanies a quickly brewed cup of iced. Other features I like are the various size options, the eventual option to get a Carafe, the sleek design, the touch screen display, and the quiet operation (MUCH quieter than my old one!). It really is a nice looking, well functioning machine! The only downside to this Keurig is the fact that you can only use Keurig sanctioned K-cups and that I can\'t use my \"My K-Cup\" to brew whatever I want anymore. That is definitely a bummer.

The dials are confusing, and the print on them is so tiny and badly placed that you need to set the oven on its back side to read it.  Making a slice of toast requires that you turn the timer dial clockwise past the number 10 (10 minutes, I think), then counterclockwise back to one of three tiny icons that represent slices of toast: light, medium, dark.  These are very close together on the left side of the dial, and all that twisting feels like the dial will fall off, but that is the only way to make the toaster turn off automatically.  The heating unit does heat pretty quickly, but I think it may be too quick: the toast burns on the outside without being affected inside at all.  You better like your toast very crispy, even on medium setting.  This may all work better if you are planning to bake more often than toast, but I really bought this for toasting (especially bagels, or I would have bought a slot toaster) and things like grilled cheese (which doesn\'t come out good at all).'),

Every pizza I\'ve tried to make has come out with burnt toppings and a soggy, raw crust. Tator tots and French fries come out raw in the middle, no matter how much you burn the outsides. Chicken tenders also come out uncooked and cold in the middle. Any kind of pasta/casserole will be burnt on top and in the back corner, but uncooked everywhere else. I\'ve tried cooking with and without the convection setting on. I\'ve tried turning up the temperature and decreasing the time. I\'ve tried turning down the temperature and increasing the time. I\'ve tried opening the door to rotate my product halfway through to make up for the uneven heating, and boy, that really ruins whatever you\'re trying to make as all the built up heat escapes out of the unit.

Simple two row-design with the ability to flip the rack and make two additional levels. Like the different options -- bagel, toast, bake, warm, etc. My issues are with the cooking consistency. First, the 3rd knob with the light to dark gauge doesn\'t have specific levels (would\'ve lot rather had 10 clicks) so you have to guesstimate how far between the two marks was the right level of darkness. 2nd, the two bars of heating elements going across the bottom (and I assume the top) do not heat evenly. I figured out that if I center my food over one of the heating elements it cooks fine, but if you put something right in the center of the oven, it won\'t be toasted as much in the center of the oven as directly over an element. 3rd, cooking is not consistent. One day, my toast will be toasted perfectly on a certain darkness setting; the next day on exactly the same setting, it will be barely warmed. It doesn\'t change radically; it\'s adequate, but I expected more from a Cuisinart.'),

This is an inexpensive unit purchased as a giveaway until my own coffeemaker coincidentally broke that same week. After using it for a few weeks, I can only give it three stars. Main problem is that there\'s no brew interrupt. I.e., you cannot remove the carafe until the coffee is completely brewed. If you do then coffee spills onto the hotplate. Once the brewing seems to cease, there\'s still a good amount of coffee pouring down and unless one checks by peeking through the 1/4\" gap to spot black coffee against the black plastic. coffee will spill. And that\'s a tragic. For a hotel room or as a backup coffeemaker this is adequate. As a daily brewer it\'s not.'),

Well, I was just getting ready to post a positive review after having this coffee maker since December 2015, but the coffee maker just died.  :  I just walked in to the kitchen to make lunch and noticed the coffee pot\'s screen was off.  I checked the power cord, just to make sure it didn\'t come loose -- nope.  I swapped it with the coffee bean grinder which is on the same outlet and working fine -- no change. It\'s not just the screen either -- the pot won\'t turn on at all.  So this thing has barely lasted 6 months, being used once per day for morning coffee.  The carafe is great and doesn\'t spill and it brews quickly, but it\'s the shortest-lived coffee pot I\'ve ever owned. I guess I have to contact the manufacturer now?  Yay, that\'s always fun.  I\'ll post a follow-up after going through the warranty process. *** UPDATE #1 6/14/2016 *** I spoke with Hamilton Beach customer service.  They answered right away, no hold-time.  I was asked to pay an $11.40 shipping fee for a replacement coffee maker, which isn\'t too bad.  I was told it will be 10-14 days before it arrives, so I guess no coffee for the next two weeks.  :D I guess I\'m sort of torn.  This is the shortest-lived coffee maker I\'ve ever owned.  Sure, mechanical devices fail, I get it, but this was pretty damn quick to fail.  I\'m pleased that Hamilton Beach is replacing it with simply my word that it\'s broken, although they did require me to cut the power cord and email them a picture before they\'d agree to ship me a replacement, which I get. So all in all, they made the replacement process easy, but it stinks that I\'ll be without coffee for two weeks.  : I\'ll try to post a status update again next year, if this one lasts longer than 6 months.  I will likely not be purchasing another Hamilton Beach coffee maker though, come-time to do so.'),

Pros: Doesn\'t take up as much counter space as some of the big ones and still fits 4 Eggo waffles in it - it is fairly deep The oven part works nicely and cooks evenly. I\'ve mostly only used it to heat up pizza and pastries and it makes the crusts crisp, which is nice CONS: The thing I HATE the most that is prompting my return is: NO TOAST SETTING that stays put!! Most toasters have a slide or something that you can move from light to dark. You figure out where you like it and you leave it there. This does not have this. It has a stupid knob that you turn on every single time to toast and you have to figure out where it goes on the short little dial to make it like you like it. NO consistency.  I NEVER get it right and if you walk away (which I always do), most of the time I end up burning it and throwing it in the trash and starting over and trying to remember to stand there. It\'s also pretty slow to toast. 2 - You have to move around 3 different dials/settings to turn on the oven part. You switch the bottom one to \"stay on\", the middle dial to \"bake\" and the top one to a temperature. When you\'re done, you have to remember to turn all 3 dials back to toast if that\'s how you mainly use it. I hate it so much.'),

I\'ve had experience with Black & Decker 4 Slice Toasters for decades.  My mom owned and used hers for almost 30+ years.  I owned my Black & Decker 4 Slice Toaster for almost 20 years.  It would still be going strong if I hadn\'t piled all my groceries near the toaster and accidentally placed one bag atop the \"on\" lever.  The toaster burned out from that mishap and I\'ve been heart-broken ever since.  After weeks of review on Amazon and other sites, I decided to buy the newest version of the Black & Decker toaster, despite knowing that it wouldn\'t come close to how GREAT the old version was (thanks to Amazon reviewers and their stories).  Well, I\'ve owned it less than one year and this awful toaster has already broken.  The heating element on the bottom has burned out and the top element doesn\'t heat hot enough to toast a piece of bread...even after turning it on multiple times.  I used this unit less than 5 times per week...hardly a workout for any normal toaster. Before the elements stopped working properly, there were already plenty of reasons why this toaster didn\'t live up to my expectations.  Here are my top three. 1)  You must pick the level of toasting EVERY SINGLE TIME you toast something.  No more finding the \"sweet\" spot and getting perfect toast every time. 2)  The toaster never toasted my bread.  It just DRIED EVERY SPEC of MOISTURE out of the bread and browned the top and bottom.  If you like your toast to have the texture of a crunchy crouton in your mouth, this is the toaster for you. 3)  The unit is HUGE (takes up too much space on my counter) yet the inside of the unit doesn\'t fit 4 slices of normal-sized bread on the provided bread tray.  My old Black & Decker could.  Why call it a 4-slice toaster when you can only squeeze (and I mean squeeze) three slices onto the tray? These are the three main reasons why this unit does not meet my expectations.  I am disappointed, to say the least.  There is no reason why the manufacture couldn\'t produce these units with the same high quality of years past...except to make a buck.  We consumers get the short end of the deal.

I know there is a way to change the preset, but as I lost the instruction manual (again) I have just stumbled over it once or twice when I set up the common tasks.  (frozen pizza temp & time for the brand we favor)  Frozen Snacks, Cake, Cookies, Bread, & Bagel keys.  there is also a convection setting for baking (I use it to make chicken) and it does help with crisping the skin.  The timer is set when selecting the temperature, the problem is that as soon as the temp is reached the timer immediately starts it\'s countdown.  (not a big deal as you and change the temp or time without turning the unit off and on again.  you can also turn convection on or off mid cycle) Now for the things that could be better: This oven is large enough to hold a 12 ct muffin pan or a rectangular cake pan (note without protruding edges on the end.  The description says it will cook a 12\" pizza and while that is true you need to have a pizza pan to support the edges of the crust, it can not be placed directly on the wire rack as the edges will droop off the wire rack.  Muffins come out fine, but more delicate cakes do not seem to properly rise.  Examining further this is due to a gap between the glass door and the frame of the oven, the resulting cool spot impacts rising of more touchy baked items.  Muffins are fine as well as a bundt pan, but a rectangular pan will rise unevenly.  Cupcakes need to be rotated twice during baking so they all rise equally.  the alternative which i finally did was to use a piece of silicone cutting board that had been damaged to fill the space between the door and frame.  Since  this was also baking temp rated to 500 I don\'t have worries about it burning or melting and the baked items do have a more consistent rise.  (although I still turn them)  The oven does go up to 450 for Broil, and I frequently use it to cook fish or steaks.  Just be prepared to wait 15 or so minutes to reach that temp.  Living in Florida I do like this oven because I can take it out on the back patio in the summer to cook and not need to heat the entire condo.  Unit cleans up nicely, although the button descriptions do seem to come off somewhat easily.  We got this 2nd one when we got a new roommate.  She liked the oven but had no idea what keys were for what functions.  After I explained it to her she loved the oven and bought us a new one 2 months later.'),

After powering it on, it usually takes 1-2 minutes to preheat the water, and then brewing a cup of coffee takes less than a minute. For a standard K-cup, there are options to brew several different size cups, and there\'s also a \"strong\" option that injects water into the cup a little slower so you end up with stronger coffee. It\'s ready to brew another cup almost immediately after that. Generally I can get 4 or 5 8oz cups before having to refill the water reservoir. I like that it has a built in/replaceable filter, so I don\'t need to worry about filtering the water before filling it up. The digital touch screen is also backlit, which allows for easy brewing in the mornings when it\'s a bit too early to turn on the lights. Super easy cleanup compared to a traditional coffee maker is also a plus. I also purchased the Keurig carafe (not included with this model) and tried a few of the carafe pods. Everything worked as expected - having the option to brew several cups at once is nice. I did find that the coffee brewed this way was somewhat weaker, but that could have been due to the specific pod I was using. The reason I\'m giving only four stars is because of the way these 2.0 machines are designed to only work with Keurig-branded pods. So far, this hasn\'t affected me specifically (all of the pods I\'ve tried have worked), and defeating this \"feature\" is supposed to be trivial, but I hate the idea of DRM on anything, let alone on my coffee.

It has the flexibility I expect with a toaster oven and then some.  The clean-up is easy thanks to the slide out drawer.  I only look at toaster ovens where the drawer pulls out when you open the drawer.  This does not pull out quite as far as my last but it gets the job done. The only fault I have found, and it is minor, is that the bars on the rack are spaced quite a bit further apart than what this replaced.  Under most circumstances this probably is not a problem.  I like to make frozen hashbrown patties in it and with this model when I flip them at the half way point, they are just wide enough apart that the sides/corners of the patty like to droop down between them.  I have started putting the roasting rack upside down to double the amount of bars which seems to help.  Since this is a very specific use I did not dock any stars but is something you might want to be aware of. I still recommend this as a high quality, high value toaster oven.'),

And she is horrible with electronics and she knows it lol. I have not had any problems with it dripping or spilling. The one CON I have is that it seems a little cheap. The handle of the carafe creaks a little and the plastic of the back seems pretty cheap. My old $10 4 cup Mr. Coffee feels more sturdy. But I don\'t think Hamilton Beach is known for the best quality materials. Its not a problem for me, but if you\'re looking for a high end machine that feels expensive then you should pass on this maker.

We only use the toast and bake functions.  Our main use is to heat/toast bread and leftover food (sandwiches, pizza, chicken, steak, etc.).  You do have to play around with it and get used to how it works.  We\'ll put in on medium when toasting bread, but when the timer goes off the bread it almost burnt.  So we\'ll take it out before the timer or put it on a lesser setting.  Honestly, it\'s not the best toaster oven and we\'d gladly spend more money to get something better, but it\'s been working for us after we got used to it.  At this point we\'re just using it until it stops working or we just get tired of it.'),

(4933, 11, 1, 1, '2015-07-19', 'Black and Decker nameplate now indicates flimsy, poorly designed junk Whatever Asian entity now owns the Black and Decker nameplate is producing flimsy, poorly designed junk. I usually use a toaster oven to make toast or cheese toast, at most 2 slices at a time. I got the TO1332SBD  to replace my Black and Decker TRO60 toaster oven circa 1988. After more than 20 years, it was losing its ability to toast. I didn\'t want the B&D toaster oven with the 3 knobs because who wants to set 3 knobs to make toast? The old B&D toaster oven had one simple lever to initiate toasting. (The ability to toast different degrees of toastiness broke soon after I got it, but that was okay -- one kind of toast was enough for me.) So I got this 2-knob toaster oven on sale. Overall, the industrial design rates a flabby C minus. The device seems flimsy and toy-like. Esthetically, it is ungalnly. The interior capacity is smaller than my old toaster oven, but the exterior dimensions are larger. It has an outsized plastic handle. Setting 2 knobs to toast is still unaccountably complicated. The power cord is ridiculously short. I suspect the device will last months rather than decades. One thing everyone should understand about this toaster oven: It does not have the kind of crumb tray that folds out from the bottom. It does not actually have a crumb tray at all. The bottom is sealed and a flat metal liner (easily mistaken for a cookie sheet) is provided to catch the crumbs. Anyone who has dealt with crumbs will see instantly that you will not be able to remove this liner with the crumbs on it. It is worthless. Have your vacuum ready to suck up the crumbs. (I line the bottom of my toaster oven with aluminum foil to keep it clean.) Inaugural toast samples were poor: One side slightly burned while the other lightly toasted. The toasting quality matches that of my dying B&D toaster oven, no improvement there. You need to watch it while it\'s working. There is no thermostat or smoke detector to shut the toaster oven off if something starts to burn. If you\'ve set the temperature too high or for too long, you could start a fire. The old toaster oven was a cheap piece of junk then, but compared to the new toaster oven, it was sturdy, well-designed, and reliable. I will definitely think twice before buying a Black and Decker appliance again.'),

Certainly we will sad if this ever stops working. The only way this would be better is if it came with a robot to grind my coffee and have it ready when I roll out of bed. But, let\'s be honest... I kind of like doing that myself. Great purchase. Highly recommended for yourself or as gift to newly weds, someone whom likes coffee, housewarming or whatever.

(4935, 5, 1, 5, '2014-05-22', 'Excellent coffee maker - beats the competition We bought this coffee maker 1 month ago based upon the thoughtful positive reviews of TVR and Alan H.  Their comments are accurate and we are very pleased with the performance of this product.  We have owned many competitor products (most recently, 3  Cuisinart DCC 1200 Brew Central units) and found them inferior to this Hamilton Beach coffee maker because of difficulty in filling the water reservoir and spilling from the pour spout of the pot.  They both brew good coffee in the same amount of time - we always use the Bold setting on the HB, just as we always used the 1-4 cup option on the Cuisinart, because we use a Krups coffee grinder that always produces a finely ground product.  (Btw, the Krups grinder is not recommended because you never can get other than finely ground coffee). The one negative to the HB 46201 is that it lacks an automatic shut off.  No modern electric appliances should be allowed to be sold without this as a standard safety feature.  Who wants coffee that has been sitting for more than an hour on a hot burner anyhow? Our other pet peeve, is that all coffee makers should have an easily replaceable heater/siphon.  Without that, no matter how you clean and maintain your unit, it will have a limited lifetime (1-2 years, assuming 1-2 pots per day), even with filtered water use.'),

Even so, the crust still gets black on the edges before the middle toasts. There\'s no sensor. Basically, it\'s just a timer with little toast icons on it to represent the \"settings.\" And speaking of the timer knob, to do anything in this machine you have to turn the knob past 10 minutes, then reverse it to your desired time/setting. It\'s a perfect irritant for a bad rotator cuff.  As for the heating mode, the oven temperatures seem to run very hot. And the little heating tray is flimsy and difficult to clean.

While the toaster appears to be functioning (the filaments are all on), there is really a disconcerting degree of browness, going from a deep coloration on one side to nearly none on the opposite one.  And this is whether or not you are attempting to toast muffins or brown bread. I do like one of the functions, the lifting of the toasted article when it apparently done.  But, it is only so I can then switch the item so that it gets uniformly toasted - and have left it lower in order to double the toasting. It may be that Cuisinart is a relatively expensive article but it would be better for them to merchandise this toaster as something other than by the name of Cuisinart - which we expect to be first class.'),

Everything about it is perfect.  It\'s easy to program, no manual needed.  I hate those coffee makers that have 20 steps just to program your coffee to brew at 6am.  This one is as simple as could be.  I love that the coffee pot is surrounded on the sides by the coffee maker - it seems to help keep the coffee piping hot.  I love that the coffee is piping hot.  I love the removable reservoir which makes filling the water so incredibly easy.  I love that the coffee doesn\'t spill when you pour it.  There is not a single thing about this coffee maker that I don\'t love.

I bought this for my son after lots of research.  He is moving into his own place and I loved the idea of the auto shut off.  He took it out of the box and used it the next day.  Being young he threw the box away immediately.  On the VERY FIRST USE the silver plate at the very top came off.  Next I found small black plastic chunks everywhere.  Once I got them all cleaned we tried one more use.  Then the rest of the silver front plate came off.  Since he had thrown all the packaging and receipts away I knew I couldn\'t return.  I literally just threw this money away.'),

It was just wore out, I use it all the time.  This new one is much nicer and works much better than my old one, and the price is the same as I paid for my old one.  Quality went up and the price stayed the same, excellent!  Makes perfect toast and grills my sandwiches to perfection.  The timer knob takes some getting used too, it annoyed me at first but I like it now, it works great.  And I\'m so glad they are still making a more compact model like this one.

(5094, 4, 1, 3, '2015-08-03', 'Heating element failed supernova-style just before(!!!) the (3-year) warranty expired I wrote a question-answer elsewhere, but the short if it is that mine failed just inside the 3-year warranty period.  The bottom heating element failed (like so many of the others) catastrophically and now neither of the lower elements work. Because I\'m a California resident (see our \"special\" section on the warranty page of the user\'s manual), I can supposedly take it back to any local Cuisinart retailer and get a replacement at no cost, or send it back at the manufacturer\'s expense for them to deal with. Except for the practically unintelligible printing on the controls on the front panel, I otherwise liked this product while it worked.  Hopefully they\'ve found a new source of heating elements since 2012, but I probably wouldn\'t take a chance on this model unless I knew this to be true.  That is, unless dealing with warranty claims is a hobby of yours and  you still have 20-20 vision to read the panel markings. EDIT: Just got back from BedBathAndBeyond with my new TOB-40 that I got exchanged (without too much discomfort) on the spot.  The packaging is new as well as the designs of the pan (moreso) and the slide-in rack (lessso).  The panel labeling hasn\'t changed since 2012, unfortunately.  The other notable changes are the (already) short power cord is now even shorter and there\'s a new non-metallic lip on the top edge of the door that lessens the opportunities for burning your fingers when opening the oven.  I seem not to have gotten a flimsy raised rack which fit inside the tray which may have come with the 2012 unit (although it may have been an appendage from its short-lived Oster predecessor oven). It remains to be seen if the overwhelming weakness of this oven, the medium/long-term reliability of the heating elements, has been remedied or not.  Only time will tell.'),

It is so much quieter than my old one. My main complaint is that some of my Keurig K-cups that do not have the white ring on the top are not usable despite being authentic.  There are a few third party brews that I really enjoy and can no longer use as well.  The clearance on this one is a little lower than my older one, my favorite mug no longer works.  I have an easy fix though, just pull out the drip tray for a second and pop back on when I\'m done. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, all opinions are my own.'),

All the heating elements on the right side (both slots) channeled into one set of coils (the extreme right) and were so hot (toaster on level 3, not defrost) on a single piece of bread, that the bread started on fire, shooting flames over a foot in the air. It is only by luck that I was nearby, and the toaster was in an open area of the kitchen, that I was able to put the flames out without damage to our kitchen or home.  This toaster is dangerously malfunctioning and should be redesigned and taken off the market until fixed.

We bought the coffee maker hoping we could keep it in one spot on the counter top underneath the cabinets. Hamilton Beach promotes this as having a swivel base. I took it as it had a stationary base plate and it was on a carousel type set-up. It is actually 4 little rollers on the bottom of the entire unit. So the whole thing rotates. The biggest problem is that it has a vent at the top of the unit. When the coffee finishes brewing it emits a tremendous amount of steam which, over time, could warp the bottom of the cabinets and ruin our under cabinet lights. So when we make coffee we pick up the coffee maker and pull it out from under the cabinet. Not sure if I would have bought it know this up front.'),

Plus I bought this because of all the positively glowing reviews on here. Many reviewers must be getting some kind of kick-backs or incentives. There\'s no way people actually really like this toaster. One thing I can say is that you never know what kind of toast you will get. Doesn\'t matter what setting you use. Sometimes burnt, sometimes completely underdone, many times the two sides come out toasted completely differently. If you enjoy never knowing what will happen when you pop your bread in the toaster, then get this product. You will love it.'),

I brought it home very excited, had gotten a great deal at it at a local store (sorry, not Amazon for a change), and after reading and following instructions, the info screen told me that the cup I\'d put in could not be used.

I had a Cuisenart Toaster oven for 5 years-it was the second one-the first one lasted 7 years!  However they don\'t offer that particular style any more, which sucks. I first ordered a Breville convection.  It was HUGE-much too big for my studio kitchen area.  Sent that back and ordered a little Panasonic which was the absolute mini toaster oven.  After burning my cookies for the second time, I decided to find a more traditional toaster oven. While this is really too large, it isn\'t as big as the Breville however and the price is super.  It has a pizza bump out, bakes cookies (I make \'special\' cookies and need a temp control!)  It comes with 4 rack positions and fully adjustable presets. Included  is a pan for broiling which works nicely.  The crumb tray removes from the FRONT!! a Great Feature in my opinion.  I lined both the crumb tray and broiler pan with oven liners that help with clean up-I wish I\'d known about them before.  The convection feature takes a bit to get to get used to but the suggestion to drop the temperature by 25 degrees helped not overcook the things I use it for. Frozen pizza, bagels, regular toast all came out perfectly.  Tonight I baked teriyaki chicken breasts and red potatoes-the oven is big enough for 2 small pyrex / corning ware style containers which makes cooking different things easy. I don\'t love this as much as my Cuisenart one but it\'s nice and practical for most things.'),

Following the instruction manual, I tried several times, but was never able to get toast consistently to come out between warm or burned. I had to manually twist the timer back to shut it off to achieve results I would call enjoyable toast. I don\'t want to have to monitor the toaster to get it to toast properly. I am very disappointed with this on a basic level; it may work fine for baking small items or reheating, but if you plan on using a toaster oven frequently for toast, tI would recommend seeking another product.'),

There are rollers on the bottom so you can pulled forward and back with ease along with rotating it to access the container that you put your water into. This container can be removed, so you can easily fill it at the sink or you can flip the lid and use the coffee pot to pour water into it. There are numbers on the side so you can measure how many cups of water you wish to add. This coffee machine should fit under any standard cupboard, with room to flip the lid for the water container. The display is nice and bright, the settings are easy to read, and it\'s pretty simple to program if you want your coffee read for you in the morning. There are several temperature settings for the heat plate that keeps your coffee warm while it sits in the pot. There is an automatic shutoff in case you forget to turn it off. The temperature of the coffee seems to be just what I like. I don\'t burn my lips drinking it right out of the pot. Right under the display, and right above the coffee pot, is the area that swings out so you can add your coffee grounds. The pot has a no drip feature which works quite well. Overall, after a years worth of uses, it\'s still working as intended. The only drawbacks so far have been the front plate around the display comes a bit loose, it pops up and can easily be popped back into place. And the numbers on the side of the water container have rubbed off in certain spots. Other than that, I have been very happy.'),

It explains in the manual that when you see the \"Clean\" light blinking, to follow the cleaning instructions with vinegar and water.  We have done that faithfully and that machine lasted longer for us than any other coffee pot we have ever owned!  (ps, the old machine had a normal cord that was not stuffed inside the machine) Just recently, our machine has needed cleaned much more frequently than usual - so in an effort to avoid being caught high and dry, we got on amazon and purchased the same machine, but new for $90.  When I pulled it out of the box, the cord was only sticking out about 4 inches.  It didn\'t seem to want to come out any further, and I was scared I would hyper-extend it.  Then I read in the manual that it has a short cord for safety and that you can use an extension cord if it\'s not long enough.  Well, I was pretty frustrated with this because I really didn\'t want to use an extension cord!!  So, I you-tubed the machine and read the question/answer on amazon and apparently I\'m not alone in my plight. THE ACTUAL CORD IS ABOUT 20 INCHES LONG, but it is just folded up inside the base.  It doesn\'t like to pull out very easily, so I kinda had to sit an jerk on it and jimmy it for awhile before I got enough out to be able to use it.  Poor designing, in my opinion, but if you know what\'s up and get that taken care of ... That first model was an excellent coffee maker and again, that one served us for over 4 years.

Now that we have this little single serve, he can have one cup before he leaves for work and that gets his day off to a great start. I\'m not a big coffee drinker, but this is just so quick and handy, I find myself fixing a cup for me during the morning when before I wouldn\'t have bothered making a pot just for me. It\'s very fast and easy and since I don\'t like my coffee very strong, I just use a very small amount (around a teaspoon full), fill my favorite \"tea rose\" cup with water, dump in the coffee maker and in less than 3 minutes have a great cup of coffee. It\'s very easy to clean and I love not having to wash out a coffee pot. Just dump the grounds, toss the very few used grounds in the garbage, rinse the little basket and I\'m done.

I\'d give it 5 starts except that there is no way to automatically shut off the oven component -- that\'s dangerous.  Also, be warned:  the period during which it outgasses a horrible burnt-plastic smell is much longer than just the \"first use\" that the directions mention.

The touch screen is a bit of a novelty, but is attractive and gives messages you didn\'t see with the old version (which had no screen, just buttons). The unit is thinner and the loading mechanism is a better design, opening more forward than up, which means it can squeeze in tighter spaces under kitchen cabinets. There are also extra features like the ability to brew a whole carafe vs. a single cup and the ability to have a filter for the water. Plus, the package comes with a lot of useful extras like sample K-Cups, a solution to clean the reservoir and a tool to maintain the interior needle! The only thing not to like about the package is all the extra ways the manufacturer now tries to milk a little more money out of the customer. The biggest money grab is related to the decision to try to restrict the brewer to allow only officially approved K-Cups. Luckily, hacks exist to use old K-Cups or the reusable K-Cups that you can load with your own tea and coffee. For those interested, just buy and you can circumvent the Keurig restriction. There are also a couple other attempts to wiggle into your wallet by enticing you to buy the official cleaning solution and water filters (which only last a few months). However, since both those up-sells are optional, I can\'t complain too much. In summary, I don\'t particularly like the new marketing tactics, but the 2.0 really is an improved brewer and our family will be happily using it over the v1 brewer from now on!'),

I just received the Keurig K250 a few days ago (Orange Zest, SO cute!) and I\'m already in love. I was super super iffy about making this purchase because I read so many negative things about this model in reviews. But, honestly nothing I read is true. I\'m going to explain further. The number one complaint I read  about the new 2.0 systems is the DRM. Many ppl hate the fact that you can\'t use any K-Cup unless it has the approved seal. This was a huge reason why I wasn\'t going to buy 2.0 system.--But it\'s not a problem at all! They have SO many varieties and brands that are approved. I don\'t see me running into any issues when it comes to the DRM. If you seriously can\'t just use a brand that isn\'t Keurig brewed, but another brand coffee maker. Because honestly every brand I see at my local walmart, works in this Keurig. Another complaint was that you cannot brew your own ground coffee--wrong! If you buy one of the new filters (Eco-Fill, Eco-Carafe, etc) you can brew your own. I gave 4 stars because I don\'t like how the Keurig stays on at all times. There\'s a power button on the screen that doesn\'t do anything. I know I could just unplug it, but I\'m afraid to damage it. However, I\'m sure the bigger models have an auto on/off option.

(5217, 2, 1, 5, '2015-08-29', 'Superb product Since I\'m rating this five stars, I obviously like it quite a bit. But I\'ll start with the drawbacks. There are two that I\'ve discovered: 1) The unit has a very short cord. You\'ll need counter space very close to an outlet. It may be that the short cord has prevented my house from burning down, but I\'d still prefer a longer cord. 2) The top of the unit does get rather hot. The front--the handle and the knobs--do not have any such problem. So those are the only two negatives I have to say about the unit. Neither is close to a deal breaker. For those wondering why one would want a toaster oven when there are microwaves and toasters around, I can report that I had the same questions. However, as I received this free to review it, I put those concerns aside and ordered the oven. I\'m extremely pleased that I did. I\'ve used it for several things and found it\'s superior to the microwave for many things. With the multiple settings and timer, I can set the oven to just the right setting and wait until I hear the ding. I know that my meal will be cooked through. I\'ve found that the fake meat patties (such as Boca burgers and a variety of \"chick\'n\" dishes) are well cooked, far better than in the microwave. Bread that is too thick for a toaster toasts nicely in this oven, and I\'ve made great garlic bread in this oven--far, far, far better than the same in a microwave. Pizza works nicely in this oven too, though it\'s about the same as in a microwave. For grilled cheese sandwiches, there\'s no comparison. This oven is far better than a microwave (though not as good as an actual grill, but that much is obvious in the name of the sandwich). I should note that the time it takes this oven to heat a meal is about three to four times the time it takes a microwave to heat the same meal, but that additional time is worth it for certain foods. And cleaning is easy. There\'s an easily removable crumb tray to catch drippings, and the baking tray itself (which is, I confess, a little bit smaller than it needs to be) washes easily. All in all, this little oven has been a great find, and it\'s getting far more use than I expected. I\'m very pleased with it.'),

Following the directions for making toast (is it really that difficult?) there is a very fine line between toasted and burnt. Using the light toast setting will get you something between lightly browned to slightly burnt with-in a very fine knob adjustment. Using the medium toast setting gives a burnt black \"toast\" I tried the dark toast setting (again following the manufacturers explicit instruction on setting the timer, temperature and function knobs and placement of the bread) just to see what would happen. By the time the timer was half done smoke was already coming out of the toaster and the \"toast\" was completely blackened, Before the timer completed the bread was completely black and smoke was coming out of the door. The \"toast\" was producing a flammable gas that was collecting and two times this gas caught fire in the oven and there was a small gas fireball, yes a FIREBALL being created in the toaster followed by a large amount of smoke being pushed out of the door. I shut it off before the timer shut the oven off. Since I purchased the \"toaster\" oven to do toast mainly with the convenience of warming other items without using the big oven, this is a giant failure. It isn\'t worth sending back so I just have to watch the toasting process and shut it off manually. In the attached photo you can see the results of the test, This is on the dark toast setting not regular oven, The bread is charred all the way through.

I liked this from the moment I read the specs; the blue LED is nice, as are the tiny bottom wheels, too.  The machine is very well thought out, and functions well.  I was hesitating in buying it, b/c I thought I wanted an expresso maker that would brew 12 - 14 cups from powdery grounds ... but I wasn\'t finding any that would do that in one shot, and nothing that would even do half that, in my price range.  Reviewers were complaining about overflows and a plastic taste, which were off-putting.  Something kept pulling me back to this machine, and I\'m glad I bought it. I have no need to preset the machine the night before, so I solved the brewing question in the following manner.  First, I boiled water, and completely flushed the machine with 8 cycles of boiling water, w/a capful of vinegar each time; followed by another 4 cycles of plain boiling water.  At that point, considering the machine clean and well-flushed, I brewed the first pot of coffee. Since I wanted to see if I could stretch the output, I loaded the grounds to brew 14 cups, and then put the cool, filtered water into the reservoir in three stages (allowing the filter basket w/grounds to completely empty itself of water, before refilling the reservoir.) First, I tried three refills of 5 cups of water; then later, I tried two refills of 6 cups of water, and 1 refill of slightly over 2 cups of water.  Three refills of 5 cups makes me slightly less nervous (I\'ve spent alot of time wiping and mopping up overflows, in the past).  In between your refill stages, pour a cup and put it aside, or enjoy it on the spot.  Doing it this way, it never overflows ... and you make your grounds go further. I always use a paper filter; but my daughter brings me Starbucks coffee grinds, and the often have whole beans lurking in them.  Though the machine is well constructed, it would be very smart to get a permanent mesh filter (just to be sure you keep lurkers from blocking the brew vent), and put a paper filter inside this, so spice powders and the finely ground expresso powders don\'t gum up the works.  Then your coffee will always turn out great; and you won\'t be spending hours scrubbing stains from countertops and floors, instead of enjoying your coffee. Some reviewers had complained that the heating plate of this machine was too hot; and that the machine gave off steam and sputtered.  Well, if you see steam, you know your water is being heated up to be hot enough to brew good coffee.  When you hear sputtering, and then it stops, you can shut off the switch (which will shut the heat plate), and wait for the coffee to empty the brewing container.  Then add your next refill of water, and turn the electric back on again.  This way it brews, but doesn\'t stay on long enough to burn your coffee.  And why do you need for it to remain continuously on, when you have a microwave and can zap it hot when you want it hot?  This saves on electric, so you can afford better coffee. Nonetheless, if you happen to fall asleep for a couple of hours and find that you\'ve left your coffee on, it\'ll be in good shape when you finally do get to drink it.  This machine doesn\'t burn your coffee, as some have said.  This happened to me, and my coffee tasted wonderful!  I\'m happy!'),

(5274, 9, 1, 5, '2016-10-26', '... Really like this design concept Just purchased two days ago to replace the older model DC-2000 which finally started leaking from the dispenser after about 10 years of great service. Only brewed two pots, so can\'t evaluate fully, but I like the upgrades which include removable water reservoir and LED dispenser light that illuminates the cup when dispensing coffee. I\'m hoping that leaks, like those reported by a number of reviewers, can be avoided by frequent cleaning of the coffee reservoir with a Dawn Blue solution to remove coffee oils that can cause premature deterioration of the seals lining the dispenser and surrounding the hot plate. It seems a few reviewers have experienced overflow leaks from the filter basket. I can think of four factors that might cause this problem. 1. Using more than one paper filter. 2. Using a paper filter inside the permanent gold mesh filter. 3. Using too fine a grind of coffee. 4. Using too much coffee in basket. My biggest concern with this design is that the hot plate inside the coffee reservoir can cook the coffee after an hour or so which can affect coffee flavor. If you consume all the coffee in the first hour, that should not be a problem, but I would recommend pouring a hot cup of fresh water into the empty coffee reservoir or rinsing immediately with hot water to prevent burning.  This should also help with premature seal deterioration. Of course, you can set the auto off control to one hour or less to minimize flavor loss, but if the reservoir is near empty, you should still rinse immediately with hot water. I hope this review is helpful to those users experiencing leaks.  If I\'m lucky, my unit will be free from leaks for several years to come, but if not, I will update this review.'),

I purchased this toaster oven just to toast things, not for baking small meals like it is also able to do.  The circular dial you need to turn for toasting bread, gives you several pictures to indicate the level of darkness you want for your bread.  The problem for me is that out of the 360 degrees you can turn on the dial, you have to be able to stop somewhere between the 10 and 30 degree mark for toast.  The dial has decent resistance and I have a hard time getting it exactly right. I\'ve burned a lot of toast getting used to it and always feel that I have to keep an eye on it because my dial may be off by a few degrees.  That said, what I really like about it is its size.  Very small and compact for the my kitchen counter but it doesn\'t look cheap.  I was looking at ovens up to $200 but couldn\'t find one as compact as this, which was a big selling point for me.  The price was absolutely awesome and for that I think I can wrestle a bit with the dial every morning.  Another thing I really like is the quality of toasting it gives our bread each morning. When I get the right place on the dial, it\'s perfectly toasted.  Make sure you remove the baking pan from underneath the grates (yes I missed that one on my first try) or your toast will be moist and un-toasted on one side and stick to the grates.  I also ran it empty a couple of times just to burn off any possible manufacturing fumes.'),

The middle of the rack is a lot flimsier than expected. Always afraid I am going to break it when doing a \'heavy\' clean, but so far it has held up. Only real complaint: On the top right corner where the door opens/closes, steam \'escapes\'. It is only that side. I can push the door with my hand and the steam stops escaping, but only if I keep my hand pressed on the door. Looks like it does not \'seal\' properly, but it hasn\'t been a huge burden, more of an annoyance really. I actually noticed it the day I first used it...but I kept forgetting to return it so now I am stuck with it.

Because this unit has a clear, not a gray water well, you can see every droplet clinging to the inside. This in no way affects function of course, but it looks gross. You have to add water very frequently, because it will not brew if even remotely low (like halfway full). The unit is quite tall, so I also had to purchase a coffee cab to go under so I can slide it out from under the cabinet to change the pod every time.

Everything I have made so far has turned out very nicely -- I wouldn\'t guess that any of the food had been made in anything but a regular oven. There are few downsides to this oven. I do wish the digital display was backlit -- I use a wheelchair and have to be directly in front of the unit to be able to read the display, and I feel that a backlight would help readability from different angles. Also note that it is well worth buying a second rack, since the unit only comes with one. Lastly, I\'d love it if the oven could handle a 16\" pizza stone, but that\'s just me being picky.

I\'d read in some other reviews about this so I was partially expecting it.  The lesson is to make sure the carafe is really in the correct position.  I think what happens is that if the carafe is not opening the check-valve at the bottom of the filter basket, it will fill up and overflow the sides of the filter basket and then run down and make a mess.  In my case, it was just water and I caught it quickly.  Never had that problem since.  I like the choice of temperature of the hot plate.  I also like the removeable water container in the back.  It\'s a lot more convenient that trying to pour water from a carafe into the top the way I had to do it with my previous coffee maker.

But in assembly those screws are cracking the plastic parts.  I\'ve used tape to secure things for now.

I read all the reviews because I got this as a Christmas gift and was contemplating returning it and using the credit toward a Keurig. The box says that it expresses more coffee from the K-cup than the leading brand (Keurig, Iu2019m assuming), by the way. Well, I decided to try it out first and if it started acting up as described in several reviews (water everywhere, sputteringu2026) I would return it. After using it for three weeks and following the very simple DIRECTIONS that came with the coffeemaker, I have decided that human error is whatu2019s causing the problems u2013 not the machine. Do the following for a great cup of coffee each time and no messes: 1 u2013 Use the fill-indicator where you put the water into to determine just how much water you really have in there. For a stronger cup, only fill to the 8oz. notification; for a slightly weaker cup, fill to the 10 oz. notification. 2 u2013 Use a WIDE-rimmed coffee mug. I would say that a cup that is AT LEAST 4u201d across the rim is what you should be using. The water gets hot very quickly and pours out in a strong stream (which is why I think this coffeemaker is advertised as expressing more coffee from the K-cup than the leading competitor) which tells me that the pressure buildup from heating so quickly COUPLED WITH a coffee mug that is of standard-rim width instead of a WIDE-rimmed width is the reason so many people are complaining of splatter. 3 u2013 Be sure to PUSH the K-cup you use (I use Green Mountain brand) ALL THE WAY DOWN into the K-cup reservoir. Look for two things: You want the rim of the K-cup and the rim of the K-cup holder/reservoir to be level with each other! AND u2013 you want to make sure that the little foil u201cbubbleu201d or mound that every unopened/punctured K-cup has gets suctioned into the K-cup u2013 itu2019s a vacuum effect from the K-cup being punctured underneath. 4 u2013 You must REMEMBER to push down the little bar in the very front of the machine that is attached to the K-cup reservoir. I forgot to do this once and all I got in my cup was hot water. You must push down this bar in order to CONNECT the K-cup you are using WITH the water! 4 - Every time you make a cup of coffee and take out the K-Cup reservoir to dump out the used K-cup, there is that bottom latch to take care of. It is the round, swinging part that the coffee goes through just before it drips into the cup. Make sure to firmly click it back onto the bottom of the K-cup reservoir. 5 u2013 Lastly, be sure to keep the sharp, metal puncture blade clean and clear of any buildup! If you do these simple steps, you wonu2019t have any problems!!!!'),

I also took a chance and purchased mine from the used category, but it was pretty much like new, and didn\'t appear to be used at all.  There were a couple of very slight dents on the top, but they were relatively unnoticeable unless you were looking for them at an angle.  You can\'t beat the price as it was 50% off the regular retail.  It came with a tray and roasting drip pan, which was a plus since I won\'t have to purchase them separately.  It can be difficult to gauge the size of an item from looking at a picture even when they provide you the measurements.  This is quite a large toaster convection oven, and is very roomy inside. Yet, it\'s not very heavy so I can easily move it around.  The front door drops down completely.  It does not have one of those hinges that automatically close (retract). Personally, I love the digital readouts because they are easier for me to see and this one is larger than some of the others.  I can\'t comment on temperature accuracy at this time, but I ordered an oven thermometer so I can check the temperature to make sure it\'s accurate.  I didn\'t buy this oven for cooking food although I may just buy another for the kitchen.  I plan to use it for polymer clay crafts, and temperature accuracy is a must have.  Nonetheless, it has to be better than my gas oven as I\'m always fiddling with the dial to try at get it at the right temperature.  I love having the timer and auto-shut-off feature because I get busy and forget.  The one thing I didn\'t like was a very short power cord.  I\'m not sure why they would do this, but the product manual stated that they made it shorter to prevent the cord from getting entangled or tripping over a longer cord.  Not sure how someone could trip over it if its up ion a counter.  If you are thinking about buying this oven you need to consider whether they have a space on the counter near an electrical outlet or use a heavy duty grounded extension.  As mentioned by others the exterior does get very hot, but I had the same issue with my Delonghi Toaster Convection Oven so I\'m used to protecting my hands, and keeping other items way from the oven when in use.  I keep my oven mitts next to the oven to remind me to use them whenever I use the oven.  The stainless steel exterior is quite nice looking, and has stylish curves.  I think that the top of the oven will be subject to dents as the metal seem a little thin on top.  I wouldn\'t be putting things on top, which you shouldn\'t anyway because of the heat issues.  The crumb tray slides in underneath the door so you don\'t have to open the oven to clean the tray.  I haven\'t quite decided whether this is good  idea or not.  The one thing that comes to mind if something is too large to fit through the crumb tray opening it could fall off on the oven floor.  However I like having a removable crumb tray to keep the oven clean.  There are four glass tube heating elements in this oven, and they are quite large compared to my Delonghi, which was four metal tubes not much thicker that my chopsticks in diameter.  Price wise it made more sense to buy a toaster convection oven because it does so much more.  The size of this oven allows you to cook just about anything.  I can cook a casserole, roast a chicken, and bake as well.  My daughter already baked her brownies, and they came out perfect.  Overall, I love this oven, and would buy it again.'),

If you don\'t do the extra dial, your food overcooks at the specified setting. My wife refuses to do the pre-requisite turn, and as a workaround sets the cook time to shorter than normal. 3. The control dials are gumdrop shaped and have a white radius line on the face to indicate which setting the dial is set to. Pretty standard design for control knobs, but the problem is the gumdrop shape and height of the knobs - unless the toaster oven is at eye level, the perspective of where the line points to and the actual setting is deceiving. To remedy, I used a white sharpie pen and extended a vertical line down from the edge of the existing white line of the knob face to the stainless steel.'),

This coffee maker can brew a cup of coffee as fast or faster than any Keurig brewer. For those energy conscious folks this brewer doesn\'t continuously heat water.

Little wheels are perfect for allowing easy motion on the counter, but it does not move during brewing/without a shove.  The only downside is that insertion of the carafe into the brewer requires an intentional shove.  Fail to do that and it pops out and, maybe, falls off the counter and breaks.

To allow for two sizes of coffee cups, the lower portion of the unit lets you place either a large travel mug on top, or flip it over for a higher ledge to place a smaller mug. Water in the back, press the button, and within minutes you\'re drinking a hot cup of coffee or tea! Realizing it\'s only a single cup machine makes it perfect for me being single. I love how quickly you clean up, a simple rinse of the grinds from the basket and you\'re set for the next cup. Instructions say to run a solution of 1/2 cup white vinegar and 1/2 cup water through the unit every month or so to clean it out. This makes more sense than the more costly machines that require descaling and fancy solutions in order to keep the coffee tasting great. It\'s a tall and thin machine, so you easily slide it beside other kitchen appliances without taking up much counter space. Black and stainless steel finish go with everything.

The only reason it is four stars is that it lasted less than one year (which was within warranty). It was easy to replace by calling Hamilton Beach, giving the model and series number, and sending them a photo with the plug cut off.  I did have to pay S&H, but it\'s considerably less than a new coffee maker. If it lasted fourteen months, I would have to buy a new coffee pot.

You have to twist and turn the glass container, upside down and inside out (if you could) but that little bit of coffee or water will not pour out of the dispenser. The other problem is that when you put in the descriptions, you can either put in Bold coffee or 1 to 4 cups of coffee.  When you press the button, you have a choice of Bold coffee or 1 to 4 cups of coffee.  Maybe someone can tell me why you need to indicate that you are going to make 1 to 4 cups of coffee.  My husband and I drink different brands of coffee so we have to make one cup at a time but we both indicate the Bold choice.

It measures 16\" long and 11\" wide, so not too lengthy or wide that it takes up too much counter space. The baking sheet size is ideal for four slices of toast - not too cramped. You can probably fit a good size piece of leftover pizza in there as well...hmmmm might have to try that one! - COOKING - We\'ve mostly toasted bread and bagels. I struggled a bit at the beginning to find the perfect setting (the darker toast settings tend to make the toast a little crispy), but once I got a feel for the toast knob everything now toast just fine.

After reading the reviews I figured I might as well stick with B&D. The look is retro which is nice. Luckily there is an outlet right behind this appliance; otherwise the very short cord would have been a major problem. This item does a good job of making toast, English muffins and bagels. It is also good at heating up small things. The thing that drives us crazy is the ticking sound when it is turned on since there is no automatic shut off like my old unit. We are used to it by now but it is still annoying. Since there is no automatic shut off plus an inexact timer, you have to stay by the unit to make sure the toast or whatever does not burn. I used to be able to walk away when making toast knowing it would turn off by itself. So you need to do a bit of experimentation to figure out how far to turn the timer knob. Personally we miss our old unit and don\'t see any improvements in the new one but I guess you have to go with the flow.'),

Well.. it was time to upgrade my old Hamilton Beach coffee maker, ( It still worked just fine) because I was making some changes to my kitchen. I happen to see this model online at Amazon, I read the reviews which were 90% positive sop I decided to purchase this model. Well after a long unnecessary delay by the worst carriers in the nation (USPS) it finally arrived. I couldn\'t be happier, this model is very compact compared to my older model but don\'t let that fool you. Whoever is responsible for designing this model should win a award, its like they were in my head!. Besides being compact and fitting very well with my new d̩cor making coffee is a breeze. The baskets swings out and then lifts out to clean and add your filter and coffee, no more filling the carafe with water then filling up the coffee maker. The water reservoir in the back slides out so you can fill it up to the desired level and then slides back in place. (Ingenious). Programming is very easy and it makes like my old one the best cup of coffee. I have owned it all of 1 week and I love it, woke up today to the smell of fresh coffee and kept that coffee hot until I tuned it off.

First thing I always do with every coffee machine is run water and vinegar in the water compartment to get rid of any metal taste from new machine. Once I did this I started to make the cup of coffee with ground coffee. Brews the coffee very fast and is very easy to use. I used regular setting and the coffee came out delicious. Just right in color and taste. Brewed very fast. You can adjust the cup rest height to the size of your cup. This machine can even hold a tall travel mug 14 oz. or your regular cup 8-12 oz. I\'ve been told that if you use the Bold setting to make coffee, your grounds may backup into the machine and cause problems. I loved the Regular setting coffee it came out great for my taste. I will use this only. One large cup at a time on quick morning or evening or any time of day. For my needs this machine is great and I really like lit.

The little valve with the spring that keeps the coffee in the grounds area and is supposed to close off when the carafe is removed was somehow working in reverse.  It was stopped up  with the carafe on and let fly when the carafe was removed.  After a few days of trying to clean around that little valve thing and thinking that it couldn\'t possibly be doing what it was doing, I pulled hard on that valve/spring gizmo and removed it.

I had assumed (you know what they say about assuming) that Cuisinart would be so concerned and appalled by the element failures that they would obviously have corrected the problem by now (April 2014) Since  I have many Cuisinart appliances including three food processors and like their designs without having a problem, I decided to take a chance. Especially when I compared other toaster ovens. I didn\'t like the prices or the sizes or features of others and the TOB-40 also wouldn\'t look like a monument on my counter top. I bought it and it fit perfectly in my counter space and it cooked and toasted well.  It toasted much faster than my previous units.  The light/dark adjustment could be better but it was fine.  The indicators lines on the knobs were black like the knobs and impossible to see where they were set.  I corrected that with  painting a little Whiteout correction fluid on the lines and could now clearly see where they were set. I was a little aggravated that Cuisinart didn\'t see that. This morning 8/19/16 I went to toast some bread.  I looked in and noticed the top heating elements were BADLY warped and hanging down. One was cracking on the left side (see photo) and the bottom elements were warping in an upward direction. In all of the reviews I read I never read about the top elements failing only the bottom.  If I had a dish in the oven and went to take it out with a oven mitt,the mitt would have no doubt touched the top element and caught fire. I just called Cuisinart and spoke to a pleasant representative. They are sending me a new unit which I had to pay $10 shipping and they want me to cut off the cord and sent that to their facility in Arizona. Others have written that they had to pay for the return of the WHOLE unit, if I did I would not have agreed to it.  I asked the representative, that given all of the problems, did they finally correct the problem. She said she did not know!

I purchased this item in the summer of 2013, after I saw it at my daughter\'s house. It functioned well for just over 3 years and then the main unit began to leak water from the water tank. At first the leak was small, but within a couple weeks it became so large that I could no longer use the coffee maker, so I discarded it.  I mention this because I will likely purchase a new one from Amazon for $87.71 (The price had been $79.89 just last week) and was considering the purchase of the 3-year warrantee for $7.86; however, because the coffee maker lasted just over 3 years and then was unusable, I suspect that the maximum warrantee period available being 3 years is not a coincidence. It seems that nowadays, nothing lasts more than the term of any available warrantee, regardless of the item. I did like the convenience of dispensing once cup/mug of coffee at a time from the reservoir tank, so I will most likely purchase a new coffee maker and the 3-year warranted, given its low cost. If the new unit lasts less than 3 years, I will use the warrantee to obtain a new coffee maker; if it lasts a bit more than 3 years, then my cost per year for the use of the coffee maker will be about $33.00. Since I would certainly rent the Cuisinart coffee maker for that cost per year, I am satisfied with the likely eventuality that it will become unusable in just over 3 years, as did my last one.'),

I had a large frigidaire toaster oven that no longer works, so I went with this less expensive model from a different brand. I was hoping that it would be the cheap solution we were looking for. I quickly ran in to several issues. The wire rack sucks. I don\'t know why it is offset on the sides, but it pulls out when the door opens only if it is in the middle indents. If you move it to the bottom, you lose the auto-slide out (just a bracket with a hook) functionality. Why would anyone want to put the rack at the very bottom? Wont food items cook unevenly? Well, it turns out, to fit anything besides bread or a pizza, you have to move the rack down or you don\'t have clearance. Lame. If you have the wire rack in the middle and want to use the baking sheet that comes with it, the baking sheet doesn\'t fit because of some weird bracket that acts as a stopper to keep the wire rack from coming all the way out. I don\'t know if anyone actually tested this toaster oven before manufacturing it. Oh, and apparently the nonstick coating on the baking sheet is the bad kind of nonstick. No thanks!

(5789, 8, 1, 2, '2014-03-17', 'avoid this especially if you\'re a lefty Before this, I\'ve used \"Mr. Coffee\" brand coffeemakers around the same size and price range so that\'s what I\'m going to be comparing this to . I liked the look of this one better, and how compact it was so I decided to give it a try.  Most of the small appliances in my kitchen are Black and Decker so I expected to like this coffee maker just fine but unfortunately it falls short.  First of all, (this is irrelevant to right handed people), but with my Mr. Coffee the On/ Off switch was on the front and so it was more comfortable to flip the switch for a left hander like me, and also the coffee pot would stay put as I pushed the switch  since its braced against the wall it would only require using one hand to push it. But with this Black and Decker, the on/ off switch is on the right hand SIDE so I have to reach around it awkwardly to turn it off, and the coffeemaker always ends up getting slid to the left on the counter-top as I push the switch, if I don\'t use my other hand to hold it steady.  It sounds like a little thing,  but it gets annoying morning after morning. If you\'re a lefty like me you already have enough little annoyances in your life to deal with. Coffee first thing in the morning should not be one of them.  Additionally, the clear window to view how many cups of water you\'ve added on the Black and Decker is only on the right side, not both sides like the Mr. Coffee has.   The next annoying thing about this coffeemaker is the fact that you have to wait till it\'s entirely done making the coffee before you can remove the carafe and pour yourself a cup. My Mr. Coffee on the other hand was self sealing, it would plug itself automatically and stop dripping when the carafe was removed, (but still keep working), so that you didn\'t have to wait for all the water to filter through before quickly pouring yourself a cup. So unless you wait for the last drop to filter through this black and decker coffeemaker, you\'re going to have some drips. Probably a lot of drips.  and because of those drips ending up on the hot plate that the carafe sits on, keeping it WET, the black coating on the hot plate is peeling off.  I\'ve only had mine for a few months now and a lot of the black coating has already come off.  That NEVER happened with my mr. coffee. (probably because my mr. coffee didnt drip all over the place!)  And usually now  there are coffee stains on my counter to wipe up as well.  Other than that, it makes coffee just fine.  But, you can probably tell by now which brand I\'d recommend instead.'),

About an hour ago I thought it felt warm in my kitchen so I looked at the stove and it wasn\'t left on from cooking dinner. The microwave hadn\'t been used all day and looked fine, and a quick glance at my cuisinart toaster oven which hadn\'t been used since breakfast 12 hours ago didn\'t have its indicator light on, but even so I passed my hand over it and had figured my father had toasted something for dessert because there was a tiny bit of heat coming off the toaster oven. I double checked that it wasn\'t set to bake or broil and went to go watch some TV. 30 minutes later I begin smelling something hot. Very hot! Ran into the kitchen and this damn toaster oven is running full-bore with the coils glowing bright orange!!! The indicator light was OFF, the top dial was set to toast, middle knob at 150\'f, and the bottom knob at \"medium\" toast darkness. I hit the start/stop button and the power light TURNS ON!! Crap, now where\'s a Catholic priest when I need one! And since Leslie Neilson is dead, I took the easy route and unplugged it.

Things I don\'t like:  the top gets VERY hot, something I\'ve never experienced with the two other toaster ovens we\'ve owned.  And the oven door has no \"spring\" to control it, if you open it and let it go it will just plunk down on your counter.

If the filter got to wet it would bend over and fall on the coffee grounds which would let the grounds lose and clog the bottom of the basket, then would over flow onto the bottom shorting out the coffee maker. I don\'t have to worry about that with this coffee maker.  What I like is you can fill the reservoir with the coffee pot or just take the reservoir off and fill it. If you still have coffee in the pot, you can get coffee ready for the next day by filling the reservoir, and then fill the basket, so all you have to is wash the pot and hit program and it\'s ready for the next day.

It groans and snorts throughout its VERY LONG brewing cycle.  The clock, timer and brewing options are easy to set and work well. It looks good. The reservoir is easy to remove, fill, and replace. It doesn\'t leak. The carafe fits very tightly under the springy downspout--so tightly that the first time I set it up I thought it was securely seated when it was not. I walked by and my elbow barely brushed the handle and the carafe leapt to its death on the ceramic tile floor. This is definitely a design problem. The replacement carafes are ridiculously expensive--nearly as much as a new pot with carafe. I settled for this model because of the absence of good, affordable coffee pots.

The coffee maker looks nice and the black color blends well with most anything or any color you might have in your kitchen or dining area. Now, for the important stuff! This coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee, and in just a really short time. It takes about two to two and a half minutes to brew a cup of brew that will compete with any overpriced cup of coffee you might get at a commercial establishment. I like the convenience as well as the wonderful flavor you get from this so, so, simple to operate machine. It is easy to set up, easy to brew, and easy clean up. You could not ask for much more than that. There is a very large variety of blends of coffee single serve pods available at most all grocery stores. You can also get teas, cappuccino type beverages, hot chocolate, hot cider, and who knows what other items are available. You can also use the, re-usable, non- disposable filter to brew from your favorite brand or blend of ground coffee. The pods are quite a bit more costly than a regular type of coffee your 10 or 12 cup maker produces, but, unless you just have to have a pot ready at all times, these single serve pods are well worth the price when you consider the outstanding difference in the flavor, plus your cup of coffee is \"always\" freshly brewed.'),

The other thing I noticed right away is that the metal housing (unlike my old oven) is paper thin. This means the burn-through factor from the heating elements is extreme making this oven a hazard to have near anything or even touch by accident. The replacement unit showed up and I tested it as well. Again, the burning plastic & paint smell.  Ok, so maybe it has a break-in period? I don\'t care.  No appliance should have this kind of burn-off and it\'s a matter of time before some of the plastic components (like the knob on the back housing) melt off.

Second, there was no steady stream of coffee ever during the brewing cycle. Only drips, spits and sputters. It made a terrible noise while brewing and shut off mid-cup. I had to press start again to make it finish brewing. Then, after my second try at it, thinking the first time was just a warm up for the machine, it started hissing and making a terrible choking noise again. I unplugged it after water started to drip from the top, where it wasnt suppose to be coming from. I let it cool for a moment and then after I pulled the tray out to clean it and put it back in the box to return, it started to POUR water out of the top which flooded the counter. Worthless.'),

Its narrow design is perfect in our kitchen and will be, too, for others not wanting an appliance that is unnecessarily bulky. The water reservoir easily removes from the maker to refill and/or clean. The maker has tiny wheels on the rear, allowing for effortless mobility on the countertop. (I never even thought that (A.) I would ever type that sentence; (B.) That this would be a bonus feature that we needed.) The spout doesn\'t spill when pouring the carafe, the maker is easily programmable, it provides for a variety of coffee strength preferences (go bold or go home), and most importantly, it makes a really great cup of coffee.'),

Since this was under warranty, Customer service very quickly responded with new toaster oven.  I had to pay $10 shipping and handling and they had me cut off and ship back only the old toaster\'s power cord-not the whole toaster oven, so that made it seem worth it since I generally really like this model-especially for the price point, and wasn\'t sure any brand lasts much longer than 3 years.  This is he 6th toaster oven I\'ve had in 20 years!  I used a silver sharpie to highlight raised black markings on dials, which ate really difficult to see.  The rack on the newer version was really tight.  it would have been ok if it was stationary, but since the door latches onto it so it pulls out slightly when door opens-it became very difficult to open and close door-especiallly as heat causes the metal to expand even more. Fortunately I was able to harvest the old rack from the old toaster before trash pickup.  The older toaster had a baking tray with a separate broiler rack accessory.  The newer one has a baking tray that you are supposed to slide under the regular toaster oven rack when you broil.  I don\'t often broil meat in the toaster oven, but I would find it very awkward not to be able to arrange and season meat on rack on the counter first and very annoying to have to wash the toaster rack immediately after broiling.  (eg I broiled a hamburger patty and then wanted to toast the bun)'),

I have used this toaster with frozen and room temperature bagels and bread, and I love it! I generally only keep it set to about 2.5 on the darkness scale because I only like my breads slightly toasted. But it gets the job done quickly and easily. I imagine if you put it on the darkest setting you would probably be eating dust. I originally used the cord storage underneath the toaster every time I used it to put it away in a pantry, but then I started using it so much more often and just decided to leave it on the counter since it doesn\'t take up too much space. The other thing I will note is that it does make a burning plastic type of smell for the first few uses.

I would have liked to have given it 3 1/2 stars. Four is a bit high. The one thing about the new one that I\'m not sure about is that it doesn\'t seem to get as hot as the old one. It seems that maybe the thermostat isn\'t as accurate. For example, with the old one I could bake a piece of salmon at 275 degrees for about 18 minutes and it was done to perfection. With the new one, it takes 20-25 minutes. So, I\'m having to re-learn all my cook times. Another problem with the new one is that it doesn\'t toast as evenly. It used to be that you\'d stick in a piece of bread and it toasted the same, top and bottom. With the new one, only the top half of the bread gets toasted.

With the exception of the color, the two toasters were identical in appearance. There was not much difference on the inside. The heating element of the Cuisinart was 900 watts as compared to 800 for the off brand. This  allowed the Cuisinart to offer 7 heat settings as compared to  to 4 for the off brand and a slightly faster cooking time. However, this did not translate to a value that was double the cost of the off brand. The off brand was able to brown toast and frozen waffles and bagles in almost the same time.

Wish it was a little deeper but, anyhow. There are 3 dials and, well, I guess that is a small complaint.  There was not a wide enough range on the bottom dial for you to see where you\'re going so, in order to get a decent setting for toasting, (which would be pretty low), you turn the knob just a tiny bit up but, because that setting is so low on the dial, you can\'t see it, you just kind of feel it.

There is a steam valve on the top of the unit which vents quite bit of steam during the brewing process which if you keep your coffee maker under a cabinet will condense on the bottom of the cabinet. After I set up the pot for the next morning I just pull it out from under the cabinet and the next morning glide it back under the cabinet.

The first pot was a strong, hot, and delicious cup of coffee.  Also, I forgot how nice it was to have an automatic brew feature, and the temp settings and brew strength programs were a nice touch.  I decided to buy the gold steel basket filter along with this machine, so I can\'t speak to its performance with paper filters, but already the machine has saved me a lot of hassle and brews a great product.

I thought this item would answer my need.  Perhaps there are better designed and built versions of this type of toaster oven that I should have bought.  All I know is that this one is poorly made.  The toaster works well, but there\'s no way to stop the toasting before the toasting cycle is up.  If you put it on too high a setting, or decide to toast your bread a little longer, there\'s no way to keep it from burning. The toaster oven door is poorly designed and constructed and doesn\'t close properly at least half the time.  The wire shelf in it is just a bit too small, so it doesn\'t slide in and out properly because it falls out of the \"tracks\" on the sides of the toaster oven.

(6106, 5, 1, 4, '2014-07-11', 'It makes coffee and doesn\'t leak! When my about 8 year old Mr. Coffee bit the dust (or at least the carafe did and it was deemed toast), I decided to research quite a bit before replacing it. First thing I found was the coffee pot I had and was content with, didn\'t have great reviews! But it did have a leaky carafe and dripped on the hot plate..so maybe it did suck.. but back to Ham Beach, this was the model I kept coming back to. Liked the style, blue lights and stainless steel front. I really wanted the detachable container in the back for filling up with water, I felt like cleaning that holding tank out seemed cleaner than the normal unreachable depths on the back of your standard coffee maker. Not sure how helpful that is, but hey..it feels better. I also like the button popping the coffee ground door open. The carafe pours cleanly and I haven\'t had any drippy issues. This coffee pot delivers as promised, makes the coffee you\'d expect it to... and hot enough (though my girlfriend tends to still microwave hers to even hotter, so I suppose it may not be as hot as some would like!).  Haven\'t had trouble getting the timer to work accurately, though I feel like setting it up isn\'t as straight forward/simple as it could be. Dislikes: It came with a static cling sort of sticker on the aluminum like front piece, which left an oval ghost shape behind that drives me nuts! I\'ve cleaned it a bunch and you can still faintly see it. It\'s vocal... gurgles all ominously at you at random times, my old coffee maker didn\'t do that. And it doesn\'t beep at your to let you know when the coffee is finished brewing, I miss that feature. All in all I think I\'m satisfied and made a good choice for the price range and features offered.'),

Please don\'t suggest it  it had anything to do with the timer as this was my initial thought. \"Oh, the timer must have been set for two minutes and it simply turned off, as the timer would dictate.\" No, after unplugging it and plugging it back in a couple of times (because, hey, restarting always works when I have issues with my Mac), punching numerous buttons (some without anger), and cursing it out, I surmised I wasted $68 on a stainless steel hunk of junk. Maybe I should\'ve been tipped off by the suspect Black & Decker logo on the front. It doesn\'t look like the B & D logo so familiar to all of us. Perhaps the sweat shop it was made in didn\'t have legal rights to use the original logo as the company wished to distance itself from a factory turning out inferior products. Or perhaps I just bought a lemon in the guise of a convection oven. Other folks gave this convection oven good reviews. I wish I could count myself among these lucky buyers. Sadly I cannot, nor did I retain the receipt or have the patience to try to get a refund or, gasp, an exchange. The silver lining is I can use the small pan that came with it in my next convection oven, which will not be made by \"Black & Decker\". Small solace, but, unlike the oven, it works just fine.'),

So after a week it stopped smoking when using it. Not sure what had to burn off but it\'s now gone, which makes using this much more tolerable.  And no, there was no packing material in there. :) The toast dial is still inconsistent but we\'re learning to be more accepting.  The baking is OK but slow.  Our old B&D would shut off when the door was opened but this one keeps running.  Given the low price and our persistence, I\'ve upgraded my review from \"I hate it\" to \"It\'s okay.\"  The company did contact me to help resolve my issues, which was appreciated.  We probably will replace this with a better model down the line but right now this will do. Our old B&D toaster oven, which we liked, finally died and we purchased this. The larger one seemed too large and we thought this would be comparable to what we had. Wrong! Similar dimensions but not so similar innards. We have tried both toasting and baking several times now and here are our results:  So if you\'re wanting to toast...there\'s a timer that ticks and you have to turn the stiff knob all the way to the right and then back to where you think you might want the setting to be.  There are a range of settings to put the dial between - black, light, and 0. The black setting gives you cremation toast, filling the house with smoke and setting off detectors, the light setting gives you either black toast or nothing at all depending on the phase of the moon and the cosmos at the moment and the 0, well, that actually works.  We are not amused.  If you\'re wanting to bake...the tray that goes under the rack is smaller than the rack so you\'re limited in that respect.  If you want to use your own tray you can\'t because the rack is too high and whatever is in your tray will hit or almost hit the top element. Both toasting and baking, even for brief amounts of time, result in smoke coming out of the sides and knob holes. The only good thing about this is that it\'s not very expensive so we will just put it out on the curb rather than pay to send it back.

No, this machine isn\'t a cold brew machine but it really doesn\'t matter. The iced k-cups are more strong so when you add ice you still get a great flavor not even watered down!

THE GOOD: -It is stylish and sleek. -The water filler being on the back (rather than filling up the coffee pot with water and then pouring it into the back of the device) is extremely simple and convenient. -Having the coffee basket be accessible through the swing open door (rather than the top of the device opening) is also very convenient and prevents you from having to keep the coffee on the edge of the counter to remain wide open so the interior fixtures can dry after making a pot of coffee. -The coffee pot itself has an extra plastic piece along the pouring spout, which has prevented any dripping from the pot to a cup. -Coffee also stays a great temperature when left on without having a burnt taste and also has 3 great brewing options (1-4 cups, regular, and bold). THE BAD (but not really bad unless you\'re not thinking): -The only, only comment I would make is if you are storing this on a counter top that has cabinets over it to pull the coffee maker out from under the cabinets while the coffee is brewing. We haven\'t had any incidents, but are doing this just as a precaution not to have the steam from the brewing mess up the underside of wood of our cabinets.

(6268, 5, 1, 5, '2015-02-15', 'So far, very pleased. Just fired this up for my first cups of coffee, so this is an early-days review.  I am replacing a coffee maker that I can\'t remember how old it is, but at least 15 years, so this was a big step.  But so far I am quite pleased with the combination of useful features and reasonable price. What I like/love: I love the lack of handedness.  I\'m a lefty and my old maker required precision pouring into a tiny opening that was meant for a right handed person to use from the rear of the unit.  With the lift out water reservoir, that problem is totally eliminated.  And while the basket button is on the right (no biggie), when the basket is open for use it is equally easy for either hand.  Bravo! And speaking of the reservoir, if one really doesn\'t want to remove it, it can be used in the traditional way by pulling out the unit, lifting the lid and filling it from the carafe or Brita pitcher or whatever.  I found that the water in/coffee out ratio was pretty darn close and I like that. I like the blue light - I can read everything quite easily and since I don\'t sleep in the kitchen, it isn\'t bothersome at night.  I like the setting choices - I tried the regular brew setting this morning and found it a bit weaker than I like, so I\'ll be trying bold tomorrow (even if it is a bit slower).  I like the keep warm choices.  I used maximum while the coffee brewed and once I poured my first (satisfyingly hot) cup, I turned it down to medium. That worked quite well since the last cup (3rd) was as fresh tasting as the first. I like the profile of the unit and the wheels.  The unit rotates easily and it is narrower than my old one, so takes up less counter space.  I really, really like that the carafe is truly dripless - amazing.  I\'m so used to raising the lid in order to pour without drips that I have to keep reminding myself not to do that with this one.  But that leads me to my one discovered con - I don\'t like the fact that the genius carafe means that the last drop never truly comes out.  Drip prevention is thanks to a small shelf just below the spout (on the inside) that has an opening that channels the coffee to the spout and doesn\'t allow it to the sides.  But to get the next to last drops one has to hold the carafe upside down (literally) and then to get the very last drops out, I have to hold it upside down over the sink and shake.  So I guess it\'s a trade off  - no drips but also no last drop in the cup - but a bit of a flaw nonetheless. I\'ll try to remember to check back in a couple of months from now, after the unit has gone through its once a day routine for a while, and we\'ll see how it\'s doing.'),

Spoke with Keurig twice - they told me not to use tap water (bottled didn\'t make any difference, though) and that the new technology required more cleaning of the needles (which is why they give you a cleaning attachment - that was kind of my first red flag when I opened the box). It\'s a laugh that they think this machine is in any way capable of brewing a whole carafe (carafe sold separately, of course). They did send me two boxes of pods and offered to replace the machine. But, if this is the new technology, they\'ve got quality issues. I\'m exchanging it for a Mr. Coffee. Oh, and it\'s awful how you can\'t use the refillable cups with the 2.0 tech.

I have no issues with any of its cooking functions. The elements do have that shielding which is good and bad. If I put in a very heavy dish (ceramic filled with lasagna), the grate will occasionally jump out of its groove when you aren\'t careful enough sliding it in and crash down. The shield has saved the elements several times. This also means that butter, cheese, crumbs can collect and smoke or catch fire. Just use common sense and you\'ll be fine. We have owned 2 of these. The first lasted several years until one or both top elements burned out. We then ordered the same model (it went stainless steel in the meantime) which lasted almost 2 1/2 years...then one of the top elements burned out. To be fair, we use this oven EVERY DAY, often multiple times a day. It has been a workhorse! The outside does get hot, just don\'t touch or put anything on or against it. The words for the buttons have worn almost completely off, which to me would be a no-brainer kind of thing for the manufacturer to have fixed over the years.

Always burns toast in the back.  Seems like that curved part in the back would be a good idea but it looks like it concentrates the heat on the back part of the toast.  And even more uneven is that it burns it more on the bottom than the top. 2.  The toast timer is very vague (bottom knob).  It is hard to get the same amount of time every time.  My last toaster simply had light, medium, and dark and it did the same time each time.  This variable knob just does not work well. The toaster is not all bad.

If we ate more toast I would have returned it to the department store where I bought it on sale about 8 months ago. It\'s too late to now but I will get a new one in a different brand before we have more overnight guests.'),

Keurig made it so inconvenient that their own older style K-Cups will not work in this machine.  Thankfully there is a way around their desire to monopolize the K-Cup industry.  First, if you have some K-Cups that are 2.0 compliant, save the lid & put it over your non compliant K-Cup & then you can use your non approved K-Cup.  You can also buy special stickers (I haven\'t tried this).  Last you can order a re-usable brewer cup to brew your own loose coffees & teas.  I ordered the & can happily tell you that it works perfectly.  I love it! Once you get past the K-Cup situation, the Keurig really is fantastic for it\'s convenience, ease of use, & space saving abilities.  The touch screen is very sensitive, even with wet fingers.  I love having one machine for coffee, tea & cocoa.  This means no more separate machines to satisfy everyone\'s tastes.  This frees up precious counter space in my teeny tiny kitchen, so this is a big deal in my household.  You can even purchase that the brewer sits on, saving even more space. Overall (aside from the proprietary nonsense with the cups) the whole family loves this machine.');

I like the appearance of this one much better; it\'s not bulky, but compact and looks nice on the counter. Instead of buttons to choose cup size, there is a 2 inch black and white touch display. I love this feature. And there is also a strength control setting and a Hot Cocoa/Other setting. My husband drinks one cup of coffee a day, using the Folgers K-Cup with the Keurig Brewed seal. I drink two, sometimes three cups of tea, using Twining Green Tea and Twining Chai Black Tea K-Cup with the Keurig Brewed Seal. There are over 500+ different varieties, from 75 brands - way more than enough to choose from if we want a change. This system came with three coffee K-Cups and a Hot Cocoa K-Cup. Also included was one water filter handle and two charcoal filters and one descaling solution. Keurig Carafe is sold separately.

They were super fast (5-6 minutes for a full pot) and definitely required less coffee.  The Brauns were made in Germany and achieved a bit of \"cult like\" status, we had to buy them used on Ebay, but after a couple years they were getting tired so we tried this machine.  It is well made, convenient, and IMO far better than the Mr. Coffee machines.  The best part is the large bright display that makes seeing and setting the time very easy compared to other machines.  The slow brew time is not a problem if you are setting it to go off the next morning, just allow plenty of time.  But if you want a pot right now it is tedious to wait.  I have no idea why it takes so much coffee to achieve a normal brew strength, but we now use the \"bold\" setting and about 25% more coffee than we used to.

The product is oddly engineered with a crumb tray that blocks the heat element on the bottom when you want to toast bread which is the primary use, I would think, of a crumb tray. The manual timer is irritating which is small potatoes compared to the fact that both upper and lower heating elements run any time the oven is in use.

The cup rest can be moved up one notch to fit smaller cups. The power button offers \"strong\" brew and regular brew. When all is set up and the power button is pushed, it takes about 45 seconds to know it is doing anything, then is starts to make slight \'boiling\' sounds then a murring sound as the coffee starts filling the cup.

It had a digital control with a scale of 1 - 10.  Anything over 3 was black.  This unit has an analog controls for finer settings.  So far so good, but I have to keep the control between the 9:00 and 9:30 position.  The 10:00 position will significantly blacken bread and just about light frosted pop tarts on fire.  The limited useful range of the toast control makes it difficult to adjust consistently for different foods. The multi-position rack is also poorly designed for the most common usage of toasting.  Installing it in the toast position (so the rack pull-out lever works and the bread is at the mid-point of the elements) puts the front cross bar of the rack above the wires that support the food.  That makes it impossible to slide the toast out.  It has to be lifted over the front bar.  Flipping the rack over puts the bottom closer to the elements than the top.  That\'s good for doing bagels cut side down, but not so good for bread. Now begins the search for a decent toaster. Update: - I just noticed that the rack on mine does not match the picture.  The small support wires are welded on the opposite side of the larger frame wires which creates the issue with toast not sliding out easily.'),

In fact, part of the lettering was already off when we received it.  I had this issue with our previous oven (a Cuisinart), so it\'s common enough.  It may very well get to the point after a year of regular cleaning, that there will be no lettering left. 2.  The door has nothing stopping it from slamming into your countertop.  If you\'re a little clumsy, this means you could scratch your countertop or possibly even damage the door if it slips out of your hand.  Most importantly, the handle rests directly on the counter, and in order to close it, you have to slide your hand under it.  If you miss, you might slide your hand between the handle and the glass, which gets very hot, and burn yourself.  This could have easily been avoided by including a catch that prevents the door from opening past horizontal, or simply reshaping the handle so that the corners come into contact with the counter (perhaps with some rubber bumpers on there) and leaving a gap under the middle of the handle. 3.  It makes totally unnecessary and obnoxious beeps every time you press buttons.

Heats perfect with lots of toasting adjustment, bakes everything and preheats in just a minute or two and uses a lot less energy than an oven. The convection bakes things in about 5-10 minutes vs 30-45 minutes in a standard oven!! This is replacing my microwave for most everything except maybe microwave popcorn, which I could live without anyway. I make plenty of food from frozen and it does beautifully cooking food through and crisping things without burning if your careful whereas the microwave made food chewy and hard. The digital buttons are so easy to use but reading the quick start manual/guide is essential to know which buttons to push first in order to set the timer, toast adjustment, and temperature controls. Buttons are really easy even for a non-tech savvy person. It is smaller than some dimensions online quote, and even the box it came in had wrong dimensions. It fits on a small space on the countertop but you can put full sized plates to bake and pizzas in it. I\'m glad I didn\'t buy a \"compact\" size oven, not sure it would fit much for food in it or be worth taking up any counter space.'),

My last fancy coffee maker, I tried to clean the internal water tank twice.  First time I spill water on the grinder motor and broke it.  The next time I got paper towels wedged in a crevice that I barely got out.  Never could clean it well.  My old coffee maker also had a cover over the coffee filter.  This cover had lots of grooves and was impossible to clean.  My old maker had a stainless carafe.  I worried I may need one, but I\'m thrilled with the glass and heater that keeps coffee very hot.

Searched high and low, read all reviews, and ended up with this one.  We were sick of paying high dollar for a machine that literally dies in a couple of years or is on a crazy recall list for potential fire hazards!  Settled on this one and haven\'t been disappointed.  Works well, makes a decent pot of coffee, and I like the ease of use with the timer and clock.  As others have noted, this one does NOT have a bell or signal to let you know when it\'s done brewing, and I kind of don\'t like that.  But it\'s so minor I can live without it.  I love that you can remove the tank and fill it directly with water at your fridge or sink, etc., instead of filling the pot up and then pouring into the tank.  Just one less step and it\'s a nice touch.  Have had it about 3 months now and not a single hiccup! UPDATED REVIEW 9/9/2015 - The machine has been working fine.  However, I accidentally shattered the carafe and have found literally IMPOSSIBLE to locate a replacement after days of online searching.  I just got off the phone with Hamilton Beach directly begging them to please put me on some sort of list so that when or IF they ever come back in stock, I can immediately order.  The best they can tell me is it will be back in stock \"in 2-4 weeks best case scenario, but most likely later\", and they will NOT put me on a list.  Totally unacceptable.  So yeah, I\'m trashing this thing and having to purchase yet another coffee maker.  I simply can\'t wait over 4 weeks to get a simple carafe replacement!  Totally NOT WORTH THE MONEY to have this for less than 7 months and not be able to purchase the most likely needed replacement part.'),

When I broke my coffee pot and went shopping for a new coffee maker I stumbled unto a new Keurig at Bed, Bath & Beyond. It was love at first cup!

Frustrated,  I decided to give up on all things Keurig. Then they came out with this beauty... Here is a list of reasons I fell in love with my 2.0. 1. The price is nice!  Anywhere from $90 to $130 depending on where you are shopping.  Not bad for a quality brewer. 2. The design.  It\'s not as bulky as some of the other brewers,  the touch screen is very user friendly,  and I like that the water reservoir is on the back of the brewer. 3. The selection of kcups! I was worried about this one.  All the research I read said that many kcups would not work in this brewer.  Well,  I\'m here to tell you that in my experience, that is not true!  So far I have not found one kcup that didn\'t work.  I\'ve used off brands (cups without the \"keurig stamp\" on them), and the eco refillable cup and they have all worked! 4. The speed on this thing!  It brews a 10oz cup in seconds and preheats in no time flat. 5. Taste!  Every single cup comes out steamy and delicious. I haven\'t had the chance to go grab the carafe so I can\'t give you a review on that but I plan on purchasing soon. I really don\'t have a single bad thing to say about this product. I\'d recommend it to friends,  buy it again,  and purchase it for family and friends.  5 stars all the way! *I received my brewer  complimentary for reviewing purposes*'),

There are four wheels that are supposed to turn the unit around for easy access to the water tank in the rear. I placed the coffee maker on a smooth granite countertop and I still can\'t turn it around easily. It\'s the same as if they just don\'t exist so I was disappointed with that. However I did read the reviews and some people like this feature so perhaps my machine just has bum wheels?

Have found if I gently pack the coffee in the filter it minimizes the overflow. Looks nice and is not oversized so fits under the cabinets even when placed on the pull-out tray we put it on. I do leave it pulled out while brewing since the steam vent is on top. I found in the past that the steam damages the underside of my cabinet.

Honestly I thought I\'d just use this for one or two cups, before everyone else woke up, but now everyone at home uses it! It makes a great cup of coffee ...and is super convenient and versatile! It\'s also super fast to brew a cup! There is no water reservoir on this machine, which makes is very compact! You just fill you coffee cup with cold water, dump it into the machine, pop in the K-cup and hit the brew button! In just a couple of minutes, your coffee is ready! It takes a LOT more time to setup my full-pot machine, get it ready, and then a long time to brew..... I\'ve read some reviews on here, and folks said they got a \"plastic taste\" ...Well yes, if you don\'t follow the instructions, and prepare the machine, you will - but that can happen with any coffee-maker. You need to follow the instructions, and wash all the removable parts in hot soaping water -- rinse and let them dry. Then run the brewer a few times, just brewing water through the machine..... I\'ve been the owner of several coffeehouses, and worked with a LOT of coffee machines - not to mention having owned a couple dozen machines over the years, at home ....You have to clean and prepare them - not use them right out of the box! People have also said their machine stopped working. They had build up on the puncture needle, in the lid -- well yes, if you don\'t maintain your machine, it can get clogged.... Again, reading the instructions, you need to regularly clean the bottom of the lid, the rubber seal, and the needle (use a paperclip to go thru the eye of the needle, and knock out any coffee grounds stuck in there).... I have also used the gold filter, for loose coffee brewing, and it works and tastes great! I had a Keurig in the past, and used an \"adapter\" to use my own coffee, instead of the K-cups, but it was very messy and difficult to setup, as well as clean... This one is great! You just replace the K-cup holder with the gold mesh brew basket, scoop in a couple tablespoons of coffee, and voila! Some reviews on here said the had to \"bang the grounds out\". After brewing with the gold mesh basket, all you have to do is take it to the sink, run water in it, turn it upside, then run water backwards, through the gold mesh .....The grounds go down the garbage disposal! Rinse it well, and air dry..... I Just LOVE this machine! ....As I said, I have owned a Keurig before, and honestly, when I went to Walmart, I had planned on getting another one -- but then I found this little machine there! ....I saved a LOT of money! ....and it\'s more versatile and compact to boot!

One of the best things things about it (apart from the fact that it does everything except fill its own water reservoir and drink the coffee for you) is that you can use generic K-cups. We buy ours in bulk at Costco and are happy. But we had the opportunity to test drive the new 2.0 machine. It\'s certainly an upgrade, with sleeker design, more options and features, including a descaler and water filter that come free. The user interface is a nice little LCD - gone are the three buttons and plain old featureless monochrome screen. A big deal? Not really. The big kicker is the fact that (like so many other people have reported) is the absurd need of Keurig to try and force people to use proprietary K-cups. No longer do the generics work. Personally, I think this will be their downfall. There are numerous ways of working around this problem, just search the web (or YouTube), but I think it\'s incredibly short-sighted, as well as arrogant. I might mind less if the proprietary coffee were cheaper or better, but its not. One shouldn\'t have to work around the manufacturer, but if you want a Keurig, you\'ll need to (they took the old model off the market). It\'s a shame because the whole concept is innovative and I have trouble believing that the company will make that much more money on K-cups compared to what they would have done if they\'d left the machine DRM-free.'),

(6726, 5, 1, 4, '2015-05-08', 'Overall good value for the features Pro\'s: Front, swing-out coffee filter tray access and short rear water resevoir lid mean easy operation, especially when this coffee maker is positioned under cabinets like mine is. The lighted front display makes for easy reading, night and day, although I agree with others that it\'s on the bright side. It makes a good -- if not great -- pot of coffee. The carafe doesn\'t splash and dribble like the Cuisinart it replaced did. The buttons are clearly marked and operations are straightforward and intuitive: I didn\'t need to read the user manual, but did anyway. Con\'s: Construction is on the cheap quality side, with shiny black plastic sides and top. The Cuisinart looked and felt more solid. It\'s a relatively slow brewer; not a deal-buster, and you can always \"pause and serve\" and remove the glass carafe mid-brew to pour yourself a cup, without it dripping onto the hot warming plate below. This unit does not beep to signal that the brewing cycle is complete -- maybe a negative, maybe not. It\'s also slightly noisier than my last coffee maker, but not obnoxiously so. The power cord is only 24\" long, which seems to be industry standard, but why, I have no clue. With the easy-access design and built-in casters in the base that enable you to easily rotate the unit, it\'s not as big of an issue. A note on the casters: they make swiveling the unit easy, but the slightest touch will move it. The built-in water-filter feature is optional and not included. Bottom line: I\'m a \"function trumps form\" kind of guy. So the user-friendly design and good coffee-brewing capability override the cheap-ish plastic appearance. The Cuisinart it replaced was solid (and cost more than twice as much), but somewhat poorly designed with a hard-to-read display, hard-to-clean faceplate, and hard-to-access internal coffee basket and water resevoir. If this unit gives me 3+ years of dependable service, I\'ll have no regrets.'),

(6750, 9, 1, 5, '2015-01-22', 'This Brewer is a Game Changer at My House! After my Keurig was finally showing signs of being on its last leg after several years, I decided it was time for a new coffee maker. When I bought the Keurig, I was really the only one in the house who drank drip coffee, so it made sense to get a single-cup brewer. Now that my daughter is in college (and basically lives on coffee) and my other daughter has started drinking a cup in the mornings, too, I decided maybe it was time to say goodbye to the single-cup style and move on to a full brewer again. Not to mention that the newer Keurigs now require you to buy and use only their K-Cups (I never bought K-Cups, but instead ground my own beans and used a reusable K-Cup filter). Anyway, enough about that. The point is, it was time for an upgrade! After doing a lot of research on different types of brewers, I decided the best option for us would be something that would allow for single servings over a two or three hour period (we all wake up at different times in the mornings), but without the hassle of a glass carafe that would definitely break eventually, or a thermal carafe that often leaves coffee tasting a bit metallic. I also wanted something that would let me brew a small amount of coffee if needed (1 to 4 cups), more at other times (6 to 12 cups), and could keep the coffee warm without burning it, like the glass-carafe style brewers seem to do. Finally, I found the DCC-3000, and after using it for a few days, I have to say I\'m really impressed with this machine! It\'s been a total game changer around here! Flavor - The Cuisinart brews a lovely cup of coffee, with plenty of flavor and no burnt taste even after it\'s been kept warm for a couple of hours. This is HUGE, since I work from home on occasion and like to sip on coffee throughout the morning. Granted, the coffee I was drinking before this came from a Keurig machine (again, with my own, freshly ground beans, not pre-packaged K-Cups, which I find pretty tasteless and bland), so it\'s not like I\'m coming to this after using a high-end, coffee-enthusiast-style machine or anything. Compared to your average kitchen brewer, though, the flavor from the Cuisinart is exceptional, especially once you get the right grounds-to-water ratio right. Coffee brews hot and stays hot for hours, without tasting burnt. Keep in mind that your choice of coffee will factor into the flavor, as well. I use my favorite premium coffee (Stumptown or Cafe Vita usually) and grind it fresh for each pot. Your mileage may vary, depending on what you\'re using. Ease of Use - I didn\'t even need to reference the instructions to set this up and get a brew going when I first purchased it. Easy to brew a pot of coffee and easy to program for auto-brewing. It\'s all pretty straight-forward if you\'ve ever used a coffee machine before. Water, grounds, turn it on, boom - coffee. Features - I love having the actuator that allows us to fill our cups however full we want them, one cup at a time, and the light is handy first thing in the morning when filling our mugs. It\'s a nice touch. The coffee gauge on the front is also an excellent feature, and so far I\'ve had no issues with it not working. I like that I can tell, at a glance, how much coffee is left. The removable water reservoir is great, and means I don\'t have to fill another container with water to fill the machine. Drip tray works great and I don\'t have any leaking on my countertops, even with pretty heavy use. Auto-brew is a LIFESAVER in my house, because we all get to wake up to a fresh, piping hot pot of coffee every morning, with minimal effort. Cleaning - Super easy to clean. The brew basket, reusable filter and coffee reservoir are easy to remove and wash, and the \"Clean\" feature on the machine makes it easy to give the nozzles and whatnot a quick rinse between uses (and only uses about a cup of water), so everything stays clean with minimal effort. Quality - This isn\'t a high-end, $500 machine, but the build quality seems great so far. It looks nice on the counter, and nothing feels flimsy or cheap. I\'m happy with the quality. The only real thing I would change about this machine, if I could, would be having a water reservoir that stores the water and only uses as much as needed for however many cups I\'m making. The Breville You Brew has that feature (and also grinds your beans for you), but also costs $250. For me, the price of the Cuisinart is well worth the very mild inconvenience of having to fill the tank each night before turning on the auto-brew feature. If you\'re looking for a machine that brews a great cup of coffee and has a few really nice added features, the DCC-3000 is a good choice. I definitely recommend it!'),

I use it almost every day for something whether it be toast or heating up a meal. I love not having to heat up the whole oven for 2 slices of pizza or a few pieces of chicken. It says 4 slices of toast but I usually put more in there with no problem. I can fit around 3 slices of pizza with a little overlap and it heats them just fine. The broil setting is probably my favorite because I can throw whatever in there and make it crispy. French fries, chicken, anything fried, all gets back to when it was originally made.

I needed to replace a traditional toaster over which was being used 80% for toasting, 20% for reheating/baking. My only gripe was that there appeared to be many different model numbers for this toaster on amazon, and I found it a bit confusing which to get.  There are 2 models, an old and a new, and the colors black, and red have separate model numbers. I was also debating between the older model (this one), or the newer one, whose main appeal was a larger (taller) oven area.  Many people dislike the newer one because: it made loud beeping noises, the tray no longer comes out when opening the door, and is made of a lower quality of material, and no longer has the nice retro look.  I was concerned the oven space might be too small on the older model, but in fact its been just fine. Pros: Looks great small size footprint Toasts well, fast, and adjustable settings Easy to clean - crumb collection tray (newer model does not have) Opening door, tray comes forward (newer model does not) Has a cancel feature  pops the toast up. Size of toasting slots fine.  many complain about not being large enough for bagels. Toasted maybe 10 bagels, and only once did it get stuck coming up. nbd. Cons: None Toaster is good for 1-2 people.

Dont over fill with water, always fill the cup you will be using with water and put that into machine each time before making a cup or you may have it over flow. Had that happen one time. The machine will hold more than one 8oz cup of water.

(6824, 9, 1, 5, '2015-11-14', 'The 12 cup Hamilton Beach Brewstation vs the Cuisinart DCC-3000 Coffee-on-Demand 12 cup: Review by consumer who owned both! I changed from the Hamilton Brew Station to this Cuisinart model when my H B\'s clock no longer worked. I was one of the lucky ones who never had the HB leak but I did have a problem with the screen over the dispenser getting blocked and making the coffee stream VERY slow.  I solved that by using very warm vinegar and a soft brush, repeatedly scrubbing the little screen until the stream was pretty adequate.  I think I have now learned to always run some clear hot water thru any coffeemaker\'s dispenser, into an empty cup, to prevent buildup.  The vinegar cleanings don\'t seem adequate. Both models are easy to program to turn on at a specified time. Both are about 15 inches tall when closed, but need more height (24 inches) to lift the cover on the brewed coffee completely to remove that reservoir for cleaning or to remove the used grounds. That is a consideration if you have wall cabinets over your counter and like to tuck the coffeemaker under the wall cabinet. You would need to pull out the coffeemaker to fully open it for emptying after each cycle.  For the HB, you would have to fully open the coffeemaker to fill the water reservoir too.  But not for the Cuisinart side mounted water reservoir. Comparing the two (both need no carafes, which is what I absolutely prefer), I feel the Cuisinart is made much more sturdily. It is of a squarer shape than the HB, but takes up about the same amount of counter space. The gauge on the Cuisinart is nice but only accurate after about 2 cups has been dispensed.  It\'s nice but not a reason to buy this coffeemaker. The reasons to buy the Cuisinart DCC3000 to me are: 1. It brews 12 very hot cups in 10 minutes, with very little noise or hissing 2. It has a very convenient water reservoir: clearly marked with cups, easily removable to fill at the sink, sits firmly in the machine, doesn\'t leak. With my old HB, I had to use a pitcher to fill the non removable reservoir OR use the empty coffee reservoir to bring clear water to the machine.  The Cuisinart fills like the very easy Keurig. On my Cuisinart, I can see the clear water going down as the coffee brews. 3. It is easy to program, with a nice sized blue LED readout. 4. Very nice touch is the light over the cup which goes on only when you dispense coffee; I like seeing how full my cup is. 5. The Cuisinart has a larger heating plate inside the coffee reservoir which keeps the coffee super hot but does NOT burn coffee even if left on for hours.  I think the actual coffee reservoir in the Cuisinart is of a heavier material, (or maybe is double sided?) than the HB reservoir, also helping to retain the heat. 6. The holes inside the top where the water comes out to spray over the grounds seem to be of a better design, more evenly infusing the grounds 7. If you prefer to take a carafe to the table, it is not hard to remove the entire coffee reservoir (CAREFULLY!  YES, IT IS HOT) and pour the freshly brewed contents into a carafe.  You will be removing this black reservoir for cleaning after every use.  But you can remove it when full.  It has lots of extra room when full.  It does not have the convenient pouring spout that the HB coffee reservoir has, but still works okay. Pour from the corner, maybe using an oven mitt to protect your hand from the steam? 8.  The cord comes stored inside the coffeemaker!  If you don\'t pull gently on the plug, you will not have the full 22 inches!  I measured & that is how long the Cuisinart\'s cord is when extended all the way out. 9. The Cuisinart has a water filter in the clear water carafe, which you can choose to replace or not.  Nice feature. 10. The Cuisinart DCC-300 is easy to find & to research. It is a top choice in the Consumer Reports ratings, but the H B Brewstation is not. The H P Brewstation has various models with subtle differences in name/price (the ultra, summit, plus etc).  I comparison shop & want to know exactly what features I am paying for & which vendor has the best price. The Cuisinart, retailing for $99.99, can easily be bought with sales or coupons, for $80.  The HB price varied with each different confusing model number, but around $60 to $80.   11. The Cuisinart has a 3 year warranty. If I get 3 years of everyday use for my $80, I\'ll consider my purchase a win! What the Hamilton Beach Brew Station does have that the Cuisinart lacks 1. The H B had directions on it for making iced coffee, which worked nicely.  I don\'t know if I can make iced coffee with my Cuisinart.  But considering everything else, I feel this is a small inconvenience for a coffeemaker I feel is of better quality overall. 2. The HB did have a high clearance for me to dispense coffee directly into my tall travel mug.  The Cuisinart definitely does not. Its clearance is 6 or 7 inches with a cup straight up. However, if I wanted to, I could take off the cupholder plate entirely, slide the Cuisinart forward to the edge of my counter, and fill my tall travel mug, then slide the coffeemaker back into its usual place.  The drip grate very easily removes/replaces on both coffeemakers. 3. The HB had an adjustment for coffee strength.  I always had mine set on strong, so really didn\'t use that feature.  I think most of us adjust how much coffee we use when we get a new coffeemaker to fit our tastes.  But good to note. Other helpful tips I can share:  I always kept my HB on a tray with one inch sides because so many reviewers said they awoke to a counter awash with hot coffee.  My HB Brewstation, after 2 and a half years, never did leak. I still use a tray, although the Cuisinart has a feature which supposedly would send any leaked coffee into the little drip tray under the dispenser. Better safe than sorry & the tray allows for easily sliding the coffeemaker forward/backward on my counter. I think the vinegar cleaning once a month if using the unit every day is important. My Cuisinart has a button that says clean but I only have had the unit one week, so can\'t comment on that.  The HB had a clean button that lit if it needed cleaning. . .  until the clock went kaput!'),

(Damn, that was a great pot...and I do not understand the need to replace it with sub-par redesigns.) So, I went with this pot as a replacement after reading the largely stellar reviews. THIS POT DOES NOT BREW COFFEE HOT ENOUGH! The temperature of the water as heated creates coffee that is a couple notches above lukewarm. I pour it in my cup, and after a couple minutes it\'s lukewarm - and this is a thick-walled ceramic \"diner\" mug I\'ve used for years that kept coffee made in my trusty B&D hot for close to 15-20 minutes (if I hadn\'t chugged it down by then). What happens is, the coffee tastes - I don\'t know - different. More bitter. It\'s almost as if Hamilton Beach is depending on the heating element to finish heating the coffee. Which it does, but that\'s not brewing, that\'s \"cooking\". Two/three days and four disappointing pots later, I returned it and got the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT (http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Coffee-BVMC-SJX33GT-Programmable-Coffeemaker/dp/B0047Y0UQO) instead.

Less than a month after buying toaster #3, the mechanism that makes the toast pop up stopped working and nearly set my house on fire.

The temperature setting for the hot plate is nice, as I sometimes leave the coffee for a long time on the burner, and it keeps it from tasting burned.  You also have the strength setting, which I don\'t use because I only make \"a lot\" at a time, but apparently you can set it for \"small, medium, and large\" amount of coffee.  The timer works as expected.  Also, quirky, but useful for some (not me) is it has little wheels under it that allow you to rotate it, so you can fill the water more easily, I guess.  Where my coffee maker sits I just have to pull it out and push it back to do that task, but in the right place it could be very helpful.  So far I love it.

If you plan to use the ground filter you need to take out the K-cup filter holder, I used two large table spoons and a half of ground coffee and 10 ounces of cold filter water(if you close the top the water will settle down into the coffee maker) select bold brew. When using the K-cups I found the brand that I brought came in mild, medium, dark and bold; so I place the K-cup holder back into coffee maker, it snaps right into it, donu2019t remove the top cover on your k-cup, once you close the top of coffee maker it will punch a hold it, since my coffee is already dark roasted coffee I measured out a little over 10 ounces of cold filter water, selected bold brew and got a strong cup of coffee.

It has a bagel setting that\'s supposed to do exactly that, and I would guess that the fault lies with it.  But it has a related quirk in that it toasts two slices less brown on the same setting than one, placed in either slot.  In other words, if you do one slice you have to turn the temp dial down a half point to get the same result as when you do two, and vice versa, up a half for two, from one.  The cancel button and reheat buttons do no more than just adjusting the color and pulling on the handle of any old toaster.  The slots are wide enough for most bagels and long enough for most wide-pan bread.  The crumb tray is novel in that it slides out, but it slides out from the back.  I would think if we can get to the moon, we can make a toaster, but nobody seems to be able to make a waffle iron as well as they did 50 years ago either.'),

This oven emits a very strong burning smell, as in wires burning. This cooks way too quickly. The heating coil is actually too powerful. Example: I heated a frozen mini baguette which the package says to preheat oven to 400 degrees. I preheated this toaster oven to 250 degrees and still the outside of the bread was beginning to burn after 5 minutes. There was also smoke coming out of the top. Whatever you are cooking you CANNOT let this toaster oven out of your sight. Your food WILL burn and it may even catch fire. Also when opening the toaster oven door be very careful because the handle will be hot. This does seem like a major fire hazard. I also think this is a quality control failure on the part of Black and Decker, which is a risk to the brand.'),

Bad basket design harms coffee flavor. No sneak-a-cup feature. Immediately upon using this coffee maker I was unhappy with the coffee it brewed. It was too weak. A quick peek inside the basket showed me why: the ridges in the bottom of the basket are too small, forcing all the water to funnel toward the middle, digging a little hole as it flows and skipping most of the coffee grounds. I worked around this by placing an extra coffee filter on *top* of the grounds. (I know, wasteful, but it worked.) Also, there\'s no sneak-a-cup feature, so when the coffee is finished brewing you still need to wait a couple of minutes to serve yourself because the basket will keep dripping for a while. I was constantly dripping coffee onto the warming plate. I disliked this model so much that I finally just ordered a new Mr. Coffee in black from Amazon and dawdled a few weeks about switching it out until the Black and Decker made it easy for me by dying after about 9 months of use.

There are 2 orange hoses that Connect to it. The side that seems to clog is the one with the heating element attached to it. You may be able to unclog it with a coat hanger if things get really bad.

Hot glue smell to start, but it went away after a couple long test toasts the first day. Now it\'s going to get pretty pedantic: I really hate the knobs. It\'s the only toaster I\'ve ever used in my life that has big round knobs instead of the pinch-and-turn type knobs (like you\'d find on every stove everywhere). I know it sounds insanely nitpicky, bit with the pinch-type knob it\'s markedly easier to \"feel\" how much you\'ve turned one without looking closely. With my old toaster, a 45-turn was usually the right setting, easy to pull off instantly, and there was some leeway. With this toaster it\'s more like half that, and an errant extra ten degrees in your turn could burn your bread. I\'m going to see if I can pull off the timer knob and replace it with a pinch-type, because I hate grabbing a big dumb knob and peering closely at it like I\'m trying to bring in a fireside chat. If you definitely won\'t be bothered by the knob, it\'s a really good model. But it gets two stars from me because I hate the part of it I have to touch every time.'),

I like that they moved the water tank to the back of the machine although I wish it would hold as much as our other Keurig did. If you do not want to use the Keurig approved K-cups then this would not be the machine for you unless you learn how to hack it. For my husband, the coffee drinker, this machine works great. I on the other hand am a tea drinker and the tea I prefer is not yet available in a K-cup so I buy the tea bags and just brew hot water. The 250 will only let me brew 4 to 6 oz. at a time. To \"unlock\" the bigger sizes, you must have a K-cup in the holder. Therefore, to get an 8 oz. cup of tea I have to brew two 4 oz. cycles of hot water. While in the grand scheme of things it does not take that much extra time to simply run the process twice, I do not understand why the standard oz. sizes are not available no matter what you are brewing, like the older machine we own did. We have not yet used the carafe feature and are unlikely too since we usually just have one cup each of our preferred beverage in the morning.

The price was my deciding factor at $59.99 The flexbrew worked great for about a month (the time it took me to lose my receipt), then all the problems started. The main and biggest problem is when using ground coffee (and no I\'m not using too much coffee as there is fill line in the basket) it overflows in the carafe spilling coffee grounds in ur cup of coffee and down the side of the machine. The grounds also get in the rubber sealing ring around the needle where they further drip into the water reservoir upon opening the lid. A nightmare to clean for each cup u wager to make. Next problem is about 50% of the time the machine fails to start brewing. I have to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to start (sometimes several times) which is annoying, especially when I\'m running late. Third problem is u never know how much coffee you\'ll actually get in ur cup no matter if u put enough water in for a full cup or not (of course I always go for a full cup though with fingers crossed.) And the last problem is sometimes the coffee isn\'t even hot enough to dissolve powdered creamer which makes for an awful cup of coffee. I prefer my coffee hot and my creamer dissolved.

Turns out unauthorized kcups or rebel kcups, will not work in the coffee maker.  It has something to do with recongnizing the ink on the top label of the kcup.  I searched online to find a resolution and found you need to peel off the top label of a used authorized kcup and place in on top of the rebel kcup.  When I ordered the coffeemaker, I don\'t recall reading anything about not accepting all kcups. So, for that reason I am rating it low.'),

And that just means my other coffee maker was doing a poor job. It took me two weeks to stop pulling this coffee maker out from under the cabinets from habit. The separate fill tank is great! Just turn the unit and pull out. A few people compained about not getting the last drop out because of the lip on the pot, well, it is a drop, maybe two that you can\'t get, geez. I prefer the no stray coffee grounds to losing a drop of coffee. And the bright light people don\'t like, it looks as bright as everything else in my kitchen, oven, microwave, hood, fridge... pretty soon I won\'t even have to turn the light on.

It makes a good cup of coffee, has a lot of features that allow you to choose the strength and size of the cup, and can even brew a 40(?)oz pot of coffee if you get the correct K-cups.  There are a few things that keep me from giving a 5-star rating, however. While I am happy I didn\'t have to buy the actual machine, it is unfortunate having to spend $10-$15 for a 16 count of K-cups (obviously depending on the brand and where you purchase them) when you can buy a canister of grounds from the supermarket for $8.  Also, it can be quite difficult to find the K-cups that are for the pot in a typical supermarket, and even when you do, there isn\'t much flavor variety.

Let\'s talk first about what it\'s supposed to do; make coffee. It isn\'t the world\'s greatest coffee maker, but it\'s good enough. Looks nice and stylish on the counter. You can make 60oz of coffee (does anyone in the world drink a 5oz cup of coffee??!). Tall mugs fit underneath if you remove the drip tray, and travel mugs fit if you pull it to the end of the counter, remove the drip tray and then put the mug under (i.e, travel mugs don\'t fit). Here\'s the downside. It leaks. Not all of the time; that would be simple. But enough of the time that we need to leave a cup underneath it to catch the drips - the drip tray just doesn\'t hold enough. However; you can\'t trust a cup, even, because this useless thing will just empty itself into the cup, and then all over the floor. Just like today; I brewed 60oz, took 8oz for morning coffee, and left a cup underneath. Came back to the kitchen after an hour or so, and the coffee machine was empty; it had leaked coffee all over the counter, draw fronts and floor (stained the draw fronts, which means I need to work on them later and pray that I can remove the color). It\'s not water deposits, which is the only suggestion the manual gives, because we use filtered water. It\'s just a bad product design.

Why on earth this new model will not allow you to use brands of coffee that would work with their previous unit just boggles my mind. This makes the new unit more like a downgrade than an upgrade. Why would anyone pay more money to brew fewer types of coffee? The 2.0 model has no new, useful features to speak of over the 1.0 model, so I really do not see the point of anyone wanting the new model. If you like your Keurig 1.0, I keep it. On the upside, the Keurig (still) makes an excellent cup of coffee and is definitely less work than old-fashioned coffee makers. I am used to brewing an entire pot at a time though and without having to pay extra for their proprietary carafe, doing so is simply impossible. Honestly, I just don\'t see this ever replacing a regular coffee maker in my home. It takes up too much space and makes far too little coffee (and fewer types of coffee) for me to switch.'),

Some of the other things I like about this brewer is it tells you when it needs cleaning and the cleaning liquid is provided with the brewer. Also, the water reservoir is better than our older model.  We did find that the Melitta cups that worked in our previous Keurig brewer do not work in this brewer (they are a bit short).

I had a traditional coffee pot brewer and would often only brew coffee on the weekends because of the time it would take to brew a whole pot. The Keurig fixes that with no problem, it makes it so easy to get fresh coffee in no time. I use it almost every day and my 1 wish is that it had a 12 oz option so that it get more coffee per cup. However, I do like the fact that it include a \"Strong\" option so that you can make your cup stronger if you want. I think this model is smaller and more compact than the previous ones i have seen, which is nice because I don\'t have a lot of counter space to spare. I like the fact that the reservoir is detachable which makes it easy to fill up without a lot of maneuvering and effort. A few quick points. Don\'t purchase the \"strawberry\" color thinking it\'s going to be red it\'s NOT red it is definitely a lighter color. The preheating takes a little longer than I would expect, but overall it\'s still faster than brewing a full coffee pot. I didn\'t want to spring the extra money for the carafe but I like the fact that it has a option to brew for more than one person. Overall i think it\'s a great buy.

Very Happy Overall Now that I\'ve been using it for several days, I\'m happy to share my overall opinion of the new Keurig 2.0 Brewer I love that I can brew a carafe, and the design is sleeker and takes up less space on my counter.  I also love that it\'s WAY easier to take apart to clean and comes with detailed cleaning instructions.  Touch screen is pretty cool, not totally necessary, but makes it possible for them to give you more choices (like the bold brew option.... nice touch!) Biggest con is them forcing me into certain brands of coffee.  It\'s not up to Keurig to decide the best quality coffee for me. I\'m smart enough to figure out what I like. This irritation is enhanced by the fact that I can\'t even use my My K-Cup Reusable Brewer with the system.  It\'s poor planning to not even be able to use a Keurig Brand accessory with my new Keurig. Lucky for me I\'m not the only person that feels this way by a long shot and several consumers and coffee companies are more than happy to share their tips tricks and work arounds on that front. So... overall I\'m a big fan of my new 2.0 Brewer, and feel like the pros combined with the convenience of my Keurig and ingenuity of other consumers help over come the drawbacks of the new machine.

Has some nice features (removable fill tank, looks great, simple operation, etc).  So here is the downside:  Any finely ground (and some not so finely ground) coffee tends to float during coffee making process, and spills into coffee tank.  These grounds then get stuck in outflow mechanism, causing the the coffee to leak out of the dispensing spout.  Many days I have had to mop of a gigantic mess, and cant imagine what all this fluid has done to the integrity of my wood cabinets.  Second flaw - the coffee dispenses at a very slow pace sometimes.  Seems if you push down on coffee tank, you can speed that up.  So that indicates to me that the bucket is not sitting tight on outflow mechanism, and the lighter the coffee tank (the less full it is) the slower the coffee dispenses.  I like the machine, and am hoping someone at Cuisinart is monitoring these reviews to correct these flaws.

Basket R&R is super easy and accessible.  The removable resevoir is well designed and has yet to cause me any problems.  It can be removed and replaced into the coffemaker with no drips.  The unit rotates on the counter on its vertical axis on wheels under the base nicely for setup and filling.  One observation though - the coffemaker is 14\" high and your kitchen cupboards are probably 18\" above the counters, and the steam from the coffemaker comes out a small vent in the top center of the unit at fairly high velocity.  It is a good idea to pull it out from under the cabinets when in operation (which I do) so condensation doesn\'t wet down the underside of the cabinet.  But this is inconsequential to me.

I live in high altitude, 7000 feet, and this supposedly only works up to 6000 feet, but there is a high altitude function which is awesome.

I followed the directions perfectly. ran hot water through it first, then put a hot cocoa pod in. There is a checkbox to select hot cocoa pod. It brewed HOT, my tongue is mad at me. it tasted delicious, not watery. after i brewed the cocoa, it says to run hot water through it again to clear the cocoa out, so i did.

I checked the trays, top and bottom there was nothing in the oven that\'d make it smoke up like that. It was coming from the unit itself.

Reviewing today on Feb 11, 2015 because of a drip. The bottom of the tank has a reminder to open the valve while rinsing to avoid drips -- makes sense. Coffee build up or the occasional ground from a collapsed filter (I confess I prefer paper filters) can get built up in there. I religiously rinse that valve, but a couple of months ago the coffee maker on one morning simply poured brewed coffee out of the release valve, filled up the catcher tray, and covered my counter. Of course I then cleaned everything up and wiped out the inside of the tank and rinsed that valve in the tank repeatedly. However, the coffee maker still leaks occasionally so now, I never brew coffee without a coffee cup under the valve. This morning the cup was half full of coffee. I finally called Cuisinart in desperation. They established the tank was not leaking by having me fill it and hold it over the sink. Then the service rep asked me to take a paper towel with vinegar on it and wipe around and under the valve on the inside of the coffee maker. This is the valve on the other end of the flapper that releases hot coffee and turns on the light. The towel did come away with coffee residue and after a couple of wipes, I even asked  the service rep if I should do that with a Q tip (it\'s a tight fit). He said a paper towel with vinegar was sufficient, also confirming that pouring vinegar into the inside of the coffee maker without the tank present IS NOT RECOMMENDED.  Wiping  around and under the valve fixed the issue for now.  Recommended interval for this cleaning with vinegar? About once or twice a month.  I made an annotation in my manual to remind me. I would buy this coffee maker again even with this extra maintenance requirement because I love love love the carafe free operation. Cuisinart should probably revise its manual though.'),

I can drown them in juice and water while cutting them up with this or even add powders such as protein or pre-workout and this blender will evenly distribute those items amongst the evil fruit. The best part is that the remains of the fruit are delicious and creamy. Ill continue to destroy these fruits using this personal blender until smoothies grow on trees.

I LOVE it still. The most important feature is the lack of a carafe. I had been looking for just this type of coffeemaker without having to pay over $400 so I was pretty pleased when I saw this one, but the bad reviews really made me consider it quite seriously. I have had absolutely no problems. The coffee stays hot but doesn\'t scorch. It turns itself off automatically but we always finish the pot before the time limit. It is very easy to clean. The gauge, while not the most accurate, provides a general indication of amount left. I use both the gold filter provided and insert a paper filter within. That way I don\'t get any stray grounds leaking through the gold filter. Works like a charm. And I like the 1-4 cup feature. I have not needed to use the timer so I can\'t report on that feature. The ONLY negative I have to report is that it really doesn\'t brew 12 cups efficiently. The grounds puff up so much they run over the gold filter and make a mess. When we want to brew for several guests we brew 8 cups and serve, then brew the next batch. Or if we have decaf drinkers we use a second pot. So if you are still on the fence like I was for a while, give this coffeemaker a try. The price Amazon is listing right now can\'t be beat. I paid a lot more at a retail outlet on sale.'),

What I am most irritated by is the water tank.  On mine, at least, it does not slide into position easily.  If it is even 1/4 inch off, it will not work and you could be trying for awhile to figure out why.  With each passing day, though, it gets slighyly easier to put in place.

(7480, 1, 1, 5, '2015-11-04', 'I married my machine I purchased this two weeks ago and I love it oh so much! I\'m an avid 4 cups a day coffee drinker so this machine makes life so much easier for me. The set up is easy, the cleaning is quick and the coffee is hot and yummy~  *Note: Why are people comparing this machine to the mini? The mini makes one cup of coffee at a time with no water reservoir and it\'s small, meant for dorms. This is more of a family keurig. The comparisons are void. But anyways here is my list to you: Pros: -It\'s super quiet. My sister has the Keurig b60 and it\'s super loud when you turn it on, it\'s heating up and when it dispenses the coffee. This machine is beautiful if you have babies or grouchy old relatives. -It\'s fast! Takes maybe 40 seconds to heat up, 10 seconds to dispense coffee and 30 seconds in between usage to reheat the water for another cup of coffee. It\'s beautiful :\') It takes longer for my old kettle of water to heat up. -It\'s compact. It fits really nicely on my little kitchen counter top and it doesnt take up too much space or look crammed. I also put a k cup rotating holder next to it and it looks so high end hehe. -It\'s light weight. It\'s not heavy or bulky at all and it\'s easy to move around :) Cons: -The in between water preheating takes about 30 seconds which is not a big deal, but apparently some reviews dont have that kind of time? lol -If you have a travel mug/tumbler that is on the long side it will not fit under the coffee dispenser, even with the drip catcher removed. If you drink a lot of coffee in the morning about 16-32 oz I would recommend buying a short and fat travel mug that way it fits under the spout. (That\'s what I did) -It doesnt dispense a large quantity of coffee at once. So if you have a large cup/travel mug youre going to have to use the machine a couple of times. Ex: For a 16 oz mug youre going to need to use 2, 8 oz rotations. That results in 2 k cups or 1 k cup-but weak coffee. -It does not have auto shut off, which kind of does suck and to me this is the only actual con because as a college student I\'m very rushed in the mornings and so I buy things that shut off automatically( hair straightener, lamp, computer etc.), so when I noticed that this coffee maker does not shut off automatically I was a bit let down.... but not enough to give it 3 or 4 stars. :3 That\'s about it for this coffee maker, I could talk about how k cups are pretty pricey but that would be irrelevant because 1.) You can buy the reusable k cup that uses your own ground coffee and 2.) If you dont want to deal with the price of k cups then this machine is not for you. Overall I love this machine to death and it can be that I\'m still in the honeymoon stage but if we get in an argument I will update here soon and discuss my changed attitude. -Jenn'),

I\'m the owner of a previous generation Platinum brewer that I cared for like my fourth child. However, as much as I loved it, I really felt like it was time to upgrade to a newer brewer and go with something that had a much smaller footprint for my counter space. I have to say I have been VERY pleased. Sure you can\'t use pods from the previous generation, but there is certainly no shortage of variety with the 2.0 pods. I\'ve also seen a lot of negative reviews stating that you\'re forced into using Keurig 2.0 pods and that there isn\'t a My K-Cup type option. This is purely false. I found a My K-Cup option at my local Walmart for like $5 that\'s compatible with Keurig 1.0 & 2.0 brewers. I\'ve been using my own coffee from day one and have yet to be stuck with Keurig pods of any fashion. I purchased this brewer in red and absolutely love it. It has not disappointed me as of yet. The only reason I\'m giving a 4-star review is because there is no temperature adjustment on any of the 2.0 generation brewers, unlike the former Platinum brewer that I had. The 2.0 generation brews coffee at a steady 175 degrees, but the ideal temperature is somewhere between 192 and 205. On my previous brewer I could max the temp up to 192 degrees. Unfortunately, from what I have seen, you cannot adjust this on any of the latest generation, not even the higher end models. At any rate, I\'m very pleased with the purchase and performance of the machine and would certainly buy it again.'),

From the beginning I had some issues with the Keurig K250.  I found having the water reservoir in the back difficult to use.  I purchased this model because I have a small kitchen and the only place for the coffee maker was on a countertop under a cabinet.  This made it more difficult to access the reservoir.  Also the machine would not brew a cup of coffee unless the water reservoir was filled completely to the water line.  So if I made one cup of coffee and then wanted another, I needed to refill the reservoir to the top even though there was plenty of water left in the tank.  Today while brewing a cup of coffee, the maker refused to shut off and I had boiling water and coffee spill out all over my counter top.  In order to get it to stop, I had to unplug the maker.  I\'ve had other Keurig models for years with no issues, but this model has turned out to be a disappointment.'),

I have trouble getting it to blend frozen strawberries without smelling the motor start to overheat. I use it mainly for blending protein powder into juice and adding in other powdered ingredients such as wheat grass and powdered supplements of various kinds. I also use it for blending homemade, organic cosmetics. It works really well for that. A feature that I particularly like is that you can drink right out of the clear, plastic blender compartment, and you can use it to store blended drinks in the refrigerator if you don\'t finish drinking the whole thing at one setting. The blender is easy to take apart and clean as well. This blender would make a great gift for Christmas, birthdays, housewarmings and baby showers. It would work great for blending baby food.'),

Recently I noticed the right side, lower front element is \"bulging\" a bit.  It doesn\'t burn any brighter than the other elements, but it might explode or split open soon.  Amazing how many reviews mention this and yet Cuisinart has NOT recalled the item.  Time to replace this toaster!! UPDATE May 2, 2015:  I noticed that this same model has been updated.  I found it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond for $79.99 and used my 20% off coupon to bring down that price.  Looks identical except for the improvements.  The difference is that the crumb tray is all silver (no black) and slides in and out easier.

But the main problem is the tray that comes with it could be a little bit wider (an extra half inch would still fit perfectly) for baking small things when I don\'t want to heat up a whole oven. I haven\'t tried it as an actual toaster for bread because I have an actual toaster because these things never toast evenly and get zebra stripes when toasted compared to a real toaster. And to add I have no idea how you are supposed to fit 4 slices of bread in it. I can only see putting 2 into it if it was actually used as a regular toaster. Update still working perfectly. Great for little things like heating up slices of pizza etc... Just still need  anew baking tray that is slightly larger. No problem with food bursting into flames or handle melting off yet but time will tell. This is the last update unless something bad happens which I doubt. Since I am actually competent and know how to work things and know knot to leave them alone when in use. Update 9/30/15: Gave in an extra star because I recently started making small loaves of bread and realized I didn\'t own a cooling rack (In the regular oven). And I looked at the toaster oven and got an idea, the wire rack inside of it doubles as a nice small cooling rack, great for small loaves of bread. I still need to get one for cakes and larger items but that was a nice little bonus That I didn\'t have to find a store open at midnight to get one. Just be sure to clean it well if you cook greasy food on it and plan to cool baked or pastry type items. By the way you NEVER leave any appliance alone that has a heating element. My spouse has managed to set every toaster oven that we have ever owned on fire by using it improperly and leaving it alone, yet I never have a problem.'),

(7661, 11, 1, 4, '2014-03-21', 'Terrific but maybe too small This little unit has worked very well so far .  I say little because it is smaller than my last B & D toaster oven (old!) and presents some issues. But it has all the same bells and whistles, so I am happy.  The biggest complaint about its small size is the distance between the heat element and the racks on top.  I now have to buy thinly configured sweet potatoes when I bake them.  And I know that any kind of casserole dish will not fit.  But for people who do not serve large portions or for singles, this is ideal. The one tray seems to be very cleanable--probably teflon.  It usually wipes clean without scouring; overtime that will no doubt change.  And I usually insert some alum foil under a fish or meat portion when I roast/broil.  The controls are very complete for such a small and very inexpensive item. It is solid, heavy and compact so that it doesn\'t take room on the counter.  It has the bell that ends the time cycle which is easy to control and well marked.  It heats up remarkably fast and I usually do not preheat as recommended.  I would suggest that the design engineers add about 1 inch depth to the rack spacing, and I do not like the fact that the cooking tray slides in below the rack in such a way that the rack overlaps with some open space on the sides--allows for some drippage, I think, although so far I have been careful about that.  I think added depth to allow for a return to the old-fashioned side slots to hold the drip tray would improve this and make it even more functional.  But for the vey low price, I think this is a bargain.  (BIG Caveat:  I have had it only a month or so!)'),

Happy, happy, happy that toasting is reliable and consistent, and while larger than the old school toaster ovens, this one is not too humongous. I am a bagel junkie - I buy them from a Jewish bakery across town, 2 dozen at a time, slice and freeze them, and put one, frozen, in the toaster oven each morning, to produce a wonderful bagel that is crunchy/chewy on the outside and soft/warm on the inside.

Also wanted something that would give off less heat. It met all of those criteria. I have thoroughly enjoyed using it, but one must be careful. It sits on my countertop where nothing is up against it and it has room for air flow because the outside of the oven does get hot enough to burn fingers or perhaps something else. The top could be used as a warming space because it too gives off heat. The buttons are a bit hard to read, but after a bit of squinting and getting the light just right, I could figure them out. I have used this oven for baking meat and brownies -- works beautifully. I\'ve toasted bagels, bread and English muffins and am pleased with the results. Pizza turns out fine. I have not used the convection oven more than once. Clean up so far has been easy other than small bits that fall into the grillwork over the heaters can be impossible to get out, just let it burn off. The removable bottom tray is a great invention and really aids clean up. The door opens down so there is no space in front of the oven to set a plate. Getting foods out can be hazardous and one must be careful not to get burned. The door is quite hot of course and even under the handle. Do not touch anything but the handle and use hot pads. Along with the oven is a metal tray for broiling, grilling, baking, etc. It is quite disappointing. Trying to clean up this tray from grease etc. is a bear. It turns into a gooey mess and will not come off unless you really hit it with scrubbers and elbow grease. The quality of this pan brings down the satisfaction considerably. But I suppose I could buy other pans. I am, overall, quite happy with this addition to my kitchen. I can also see it being useful in a time when we must depend on back up generators or move it to the porch when we are grilling outside to prepare side dishes, etc.'),

This is because I have been burned by purchases before that are great at first and fall apart 3 months or so later. At first glance, this coffee maker is great! It brews hot coffee, apposed to a cheaper coffee maker and all parts are washable. Or, so I thought. The fact is that about 20% of the coffee reservoir cannot be accessed because it is blocked off by a rather silly implemented \"float\" mechanism that is supposed to show you how much is left in the basin. The reality of it is that most people have no need for this. 12 cups makes 4 drinkable cups (and a little more) for myself and wife in the morning with a tiny bit left over. That\'s two coffee mugs each and I don\'t need a gauge to remind me to count to 2. That being said, I rinse out the unit after every use and wash it weekly. It has never alerted me to de-calcify the unit, but I have done that twice since the vinegar solution also does remove some of the coffee off the metal heat transfer plate at the bottom. Last night, the unit started to emmit black flakes that would crumble apart at the touch. I thought it was coffee, and read what others have already mentioned here. I spent 2 hours last night rinsing, using vinegar clean cycle, scrubbing, etc and it didn\'t make a difference. This morning, after spending another 30 minutes at it, I removed the two screws at the bottom (they require a long screw driver shaft) to remove the top section of the basin. This allowed the float unit to slide right out. I was disgusted at what I saw. I quickly got excited as I examined the coffee basin and realized that the coffee maker would work without reinserting the float. Unfortunately, even with the float removed, the black flakes continued to come out. I found that I was able to scrape off the flakes with a wet paper towel and did so for about 20 minutes before I came to a conclusion. This isn\'t coffee. After the coffee residue was removed, the black flakes continued to come off the same spots and had a shiny, glittery quality to them. It almost looks like teflon when it gets scrapped off a pan. I then tried to wipe the interior of the coffee maker - the part that stays mostly dry (with the exception of water getting splashed on the sides) and what do you know. Very slight flaking and plastic strips coming off the side. I did not use the butter knife to scrape it out. I used it to scoop it from the bottom because my hand wouldn\'t fit inside. I HIGHLY do not recommend this coffee maker simply for health reasons. Do a google search and you will that the black flaking problem is not limited to only this particular model but several Cuisinart models. My guess it is either the plastic that is being used or a heat resistant coating that is being used. Either way, even if it is non-toxic, I would never be able to recommend to someone else. At the moment, I am now looking for a completely serviceable machine made from glass and stainless steel where all parts are removable and washable. Even if it\'s something meant for commercial use rather than home use.'),

Then there was a cleanser and descaler bottle, a water filter starter kit, and an insert to be able to brew your own coffee brands. This model has the added benefit of being able to brew larger cup sizes with the additional purchase of a carafe which is not included with the keurig. And without the carafe you can brew sizes from 4oz to 10oz. I must say that I love everything about this product and the only negative I have is not being able to brew the larger cup sizes without the carafe. I didn\'t realize how small of an amount 10oz was. Which I guess means I drink a lot of coffee but it\'s not enough to even fill up most of my coffee travel cups that I have. But besides that, this product is absolutely perfect!'),

I researched coffee makers to see if there was a better one out there, and there just wasn\'t. I am a coffee-aholic! I love \'coffee on demand\', and not having that gross pot with the acidic taste of burnt coffee is why I enjoy this coffee maker so much. The first one I bought lasted about 4 years. When I looked to buy it again, it was half the original price, and they made some improvements! It now has an LED display for the clock which really helps! And the removable clear tank on the side is awesome! You used to have to use a pitcher of your own to guesstimate how much water to put in. This is easy and there is no guess work.

That one lasted about 5 months then had to be thrown away, as it was leaking water from the base of the unit. I don\'t drink coffee every day either, maybe 2-3 times a week, so it\'s not like it was being excessively used at a restaurant or something. Hamilton just does not make a good dependable product and one that can stand the test of time. Save your money and get a Keruig or a Mr. Coffee product.'),
(7885, 9, 1, 4, '2015-10-09', 'One of the few carafe-less coffee makers that is not a one-cupper We are on our second DCC-3000 and there are not many options on the market to which to compare this machine. Our first unit just stopped working; this failure followed an electrical storm. We purchased a second unit because we liked the first one so much. About us: We enjoy roasting our own beans and fresh grinding each day\'s coffee. We love the carafe-less coffeemaker concept but not one-at-a-time brew systems. Downsides: This coffeemaker touts a 12 cup capacity but reality is the basket is too shallow to hold the amount of coffee needed to brew 12 cups of medium to strong coffee.  If you like weak coffee, you might, I repeat *might*, get 12 cups out of this.  We found that you\'ll get 10 cups maximum if you use a coarser grind. Putting more coffee in the basket results in grounds spilling over the edge of the filter basket and ending up in the coffee reservoir. These grinds clog up the dispenser spigot which causes coffee to leak out. In this situation, your freshly brewed coffee with continuously leak out of the spigot, fill up the overflow tray, and then spread out all over your lovely kitchen counter. When you come back to get a cup, you\'ll have a mess to clean up.  This is our personal experience because we had to dump the entire reservoir a couple times due to of the leakage problem. Both times, we found grounds in the reservoir and spigot. Lesson learned - don\'t try to get the full 12 cups out of this coffeemaker. Another problem, the gauge. It is inaccurate and just stops working after a while. There may as well not be one. We look forward to Cuisinart (or someone else) coming up with a new model or better design.'),

Opted this this little unit and it was exactly what I needed for my morning cup of joe. It makes \"5 cups\" of coffee - which in the real world means it make 3 full mugs of coffee - in about 5 minutes, give or take. As 3 mugs is my limit for the day, the amount is perfect. If you are considering this machine there are three  things you need to be aware of in case you have been spoiled by the bells and whistles found on pricier units - there is no \"pause and pour\" feature, you can\'t program it to start as a certain time and there is no automatic shut-off after a set period of time. You flip it on, wait until it is done brewing before pouring your first cup and it stays on until you turn it off. Just like the 1970s. I have no problem with such a simple, basic machine, but if you want coffee already brewed when you wake up and can\'t remember to turn the machine off before walking out the door, this might not be a good choice for you. But for me it is absolutely perfect. Small footprint, low price, good coffee. I don\'t look for anything else in a coffee maker.'),

I have a feeling that the plastic smell is from where it\'s made.  These are not made in USA so be aware! ---Original review--- That chemical odor in the reservoir is BAD.  I hope that over time it will go away, or at least fade.  It tends to throw off the flavor of the coffee. The water runs through it a little too quickly, so sometimes there are grounds in the bottom of the pot.  Also, the basket size is between a 4 and 6 cup size permanent filter, so I bought the smaller of the two, and have to watch the quantity of coffee carefully, or stop the brewing partway through to give the water time to settle through the grounds.  Or I get lots of sediment in my cup.  Yuck. That being said, it does make coffee, and my french press broke.  I\'m going to buy another press and set this aside, just in case it breaks.'),

At first there was a small 1\" long tear in the element casing, but the tear then became two tears.  The tears have grown and now almost the whole element has warped upward and has torn.  And I recently saw sparks coming from the casing split while using the oven that others have written about.  I now think it is not safe to use the toaster oven and will be trying another brand soon.  I appreciate everyone\'s insight on Amazon.  This is a shame, because before this happened, I loved this toaster oven!  Both my husband and I thought this was the best oven we had owned.  I checked my Amazon records and found that I had originally bought this toaster oven in June 2011--exactly 4 years of use.  This puts me past the 3 year warranty period.

When I make coffee I use Kcups and find it very easy and much better than dealing with ground coffee. The one thing that annoys me is having to refill the water chamber so often.

You gotta\' use authentic K-Cups with this! No way around that either. However, once you register your unit with Keurig, they do extend a very generous offer on K-Cups. I would not recommend buying this with a Gift Card promotion, because for whatever the amount, it will haunt you like a bad dream if you ever need to return this. And these Keurig coffee makers almost come pre-programmed to break down just when you least expect it. Many, many people attest to this and have to either return it or buy a new one.

Then she told me I should clean the unit once a week. I told her I would when it came to a week. LOL. I told her I only use the ones with their logo on it to insure it would work and she told me to try too clean it. In short 3 cleans later and over 40oz of H2O and two more pods ($4) they are sending me a new POD holder and a coupon for 1 Free Hot Bev Box/Bag. On the unit I would give about 1 stars.

There is no setting as in older models to change the temperature so I am left microwaving constantly. Absolutely the worst temperature I have ever had a cup of coffee. If I was the only one I would think it\'s me but the 3 people in my family all agree. For a new machine not to have a setting to increase temperature is ridiculous.

However, the size of the carafe compared to how much water it takes to brew seems like a waste of time. Also, the carafe can easily be moved out of the slot which means the entire brew must be started over and the k cup is wasted. For now, I will continue to brew single cups of coffee. I find that one K cup is very strong, so I use the K cup twice to get a larger cup of coffee that is not so strong which creates a more enjoyable hot cup of coffee.'),

I don\'t drink coffee, but I drink tea nearly every day. I love the reservoir and that I don\'t have to fill it with every cup like the Mini, although the Mini is great, too. I\'ve made hot tea, iced tea, and cocoa. I also like that I can put taller cups under this than the Mini. FYI for any wondering, the min fill line for regular cups is about 2 in from the bottom of the reservoir and is not printed. The one printed on it is the min for a carafe.

So I sucked it up until I saw the K250 2.0 system was released. I got the turquoise as this matches the rest of my small appliances. I like this one more than the Mini because it holds water for at least 3 brewings for us. The color and look of it is amazing. I am really pleased that they came out with this color as I was waiting on it! We brew about 1-2 servings a day and it\'s been nothing but good to us. I prefer this machine over the Mini because it fits many more cup/mug sizes. The only thing I find somewhat annoying is the amount of time it takes to warm the water. For a smaller-sized machine, I expect it to be ready when I turn it on, but I guess my Mini brewer also took time for the water to warm. I also do not like that I can\'t use non K-cup pods since I had a few boxes of pods left over but it\'s no biggie since I still have my old machine.

(8101, 13, 2, 5, '2015-05-22', 'HEADLINE: Ryan Braun No Longer Nicole\'s Favorite Brewer This Keurig machine is pretty amazing! I thank the coffee gods for the 10 ounce option and the option to make my coffee \"strong\"--because, I mean, there\'s only one reason for coffee! The machine has a really sleek look and I\'m really excited about also being able to make both single cups and carafes now because sometimes you just need cup number 2 at the same time as cup 1! Also, the machine has a really sleek design that would fit well in any setting. Unfortunately my kitchen is a bit older, but changing out my outdated machine for this one honestly upgraded the feel. The following are my two qualms with my wonderful new machine, which TRULY in no way would outweigh the benefits it offers: 1) It takes a bit longer for this Keurig to turn on and preheat, etc. as compared to my previous one. This is only upon first plugging it in, though, so if you leave it plugged in, you\'re all good. Once the machine is up and running, it works really quickly and despite the various features it offers, it\'s super simple! Secondly (and this may just be caused by my reservations to veer away from exact guidelines), the minimum fill line and maximum fill line seem to be only one 10-oz cup of coffee away from each other. Devil\'s advocate, though, that ensures that you\'re using fresh water for each brew! :) Editor\'s Note: Ryan Braun was not Nicole\'s favorite Brewer, rather the only one she was aware of post-Prince Fielder.'),

It works great, seems quieter than our old model, and we can use our own pods with it (just make sure that they say they are compatible with the 2.0 series). We also like that we can brew a carafe for company or single cups for us. It also allows for a stronger brew if preferred.  When it arrived, one of the prongs on the water filtration assembly was broken, so it doesn\'t fit perfectly.'),

I\'m a huge fan of Keurig, so I couldn\'t resist in purchasing this. Beside the color, I love the shape of this model. It doesn\'t take up much counter space, and isn\'t too tall either. The water reservoir is a great size allowing me to make several cups of coffee without having to refill it. I thoroughly love the touch screen they added to this model! It\'s a nice modern upgrade to the older models. It\'s very easy to use, and the instructions are easy to understand. My Keurig shipped quickly, packaging was great, and I\'m very happy with my purchase. I highly recommend this product. I will continue to purchase any Keurig coffee makers from Target since they always stand behind their products making it easy to return or exchange.'),

The only negative I have is I like my coffee and tea VERY hot/scalding and the K250 makes it hot but not overly. Not a big deal at all. I just nuke it for a few seconds and I\'m good to go.

I use my machine everyday and everyday it starts my day off great. I love that in less than a minute I have a cup of hot coffee and it tastes just as good, if not better, than if I went to a local coffee shop. I love that I can choose to make a variety of different drinks with it: coffee, tea and even hot chocolate.

It is a complete steal.  It is so easy to use and so fast.  I have not cleaned yet as I just got it and set it up in the last week.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone that enjoys a cup of coffee/hot chocolate and is always on the go.    I have a 9 month old at home and I have very little time for me in the mornings.  I leave the pod in the night before and while I pack up the car I run it and once everyone is in the car I gab my hot cup of coffee and go.  I absolutely love it.'),

This machine has a water tank and with the old machine I had to premeasure the ounces of water. I like the fun colors this machine is available in. I think it makes a great cup of coffee but I find it a tad less hot than my Mini brewer. I do think that the knock off K-cups will have a plastic taste but if you stick to real branded K cups there is no problem.'),

The options for 4, 6, 8, and 10 oz cups is very convenient and it seems to preheat water very quickly in comparison to other models. The removable water reservoir is also an awesome feature.

My wife loves it! It is simple, clean, and keeps us from wasting so much coffee. She is the only one that drinks coffee in the house and used to she would waste half a pot every day because she only drinks one or two cups. Now within seconds and no preparation time she has her full cup of coffee with no waste.  The Design is perfect with it\'s touch screen it is very easy to use. It feels very strong and not cheap like some that feel like they are going to break when you open them. The water is perfectly heated every time and clean is as simple as trashing the pod.  It is now set up on our buffet in the dinning room as a coffee station in the dinning room. All her friends love it too.

I need to fill the water tank only once per day. I use it also for tea making, as well as other hot drinks. I noticed the plastic smell in the water, for couple of days. Than it was gone. Keurig will do well to put one of these small odor absorbent packets in the water tank prior to packing. Assembling it and cleaning is also peace of cake. It brews also very fast. Preheating takes about 24 seconds form the time I woke it up from saving mode. Then I hear the sound of boiling water for a brief moment. The brewing process does not take long. I understand it makes certain sounds while brewing which I imagine is normal and is not loud at all. Have I mentioned the light in the water tank, the color is changeable between four different colors w/g/b/r. It looks very cool, especially at night, but it goes off when the machine is in saving mode. I wish Keurig posts a picture of the machine showing its colored lights on the website. I find it to be an excellent machine and more than just a coffee brewer. No wonder Keurig ran out of stock of this model!'),

I\'m a college student and this Keurig is great for when I am on my way out the door running late for class! As some other reviewers have said the water tank is a little hard to get on and off but I\'m sure it will get easier with time. I also wish there was a larger clearance underneath where the coffee comes out, sometimes I have troubles fitting my travel mugs under it. I\'m not a fan of the fact that you HAVE to use their special K-cups now, because even some old K-cups that have the Keurig logo on them do not work.I do love that you can select from several different coffee and hot water sizes along with if you want your coffee strong or if you are brewing hot chocolate!'),

I have not tried other brands of K-cups (Starbucks, etc) but I am happy for now just using the reusable filter.

(8152, 13, 2, 4, '2015-07-19', 'Very Good Single Serve Brew System - even after reading revs I waited to write a review until I had my Keurig for several weeks to compare performance against the many reviews that already existed (especially the negative ones). Pros: First, the system is everything I needed in general for brewing a single serve cup of coffee - nice and hot, plenty strong. I enjoy the flexibility of different flavors with every cup. It is easy to use, actually stores on my counter under the wall cupboards with enough space to lift the lid to place in the cups. Having a variety pack of the regular coffee and teas has been wonderful for guests who all have differences in opinion for which coffee/tea to have, and although more expensive than knock off brands, not out of line for single serve coffee preps (especially when ordering in more of bulk size number of cups). Since I am one who orders gourmet beans for flavored coffees using an online service, I am anticipating the release of the My KCup for this model. Cons: Most of the things I didn\'t like are not deal breakers, but more wish list vs. general functionality. A better staying and easier to replace water reservoir lid (easy to misalign and fall into reservoir), drip tray not attached to unit is too easy to move. One too many screens for access for dispensing water. Too long a time until auto shutoff of the unit (for my type of usage, which is typically morning and evening only - not all day use). Comments vs. other negative reviews: 1) I did not need a \"to go\" carafe cup size and did not order this product expecting it to do so as the specs for brewing were provided. 2) After washing my carafe before use, I did not experience the \"smell\" that others have. 3) I have never experienced grounds coming through the system. 4) I have not experienced any program or power issues with this unit as were described in other reviews - and the water dispensed is hot enough to burn! Suggestions to Keurig: A larger reservoir would be nice, but as a single cup user this could lead to microbial issues. 2) Programmable for specific user preferences would be nice since there is more than one user in our household.

We definitely don\'t need a whole pot of coffee and this allows us to easily make just a cup whenever we want without excess. I love that it brews so quickly and is available in multiple sizes suited to your needs (4,6,8, 10) and it\'s nice to have the option of getting carafe for it if we decide we want to be able to brew a larger amount. It\'s also nice to have the \"strong\" option for brewing and I really love that I can now make a variety of hot beverages, including tea in this machine and use the \"hot water\" option for other hot water needs! I do wish that it had the capability to brew a little hotter but for the convenience and all the other benefits it comes with, I don\'t mind that too much. Some people are unhappy that it rejects K-cups from other companies but being new to the Keurig that doesn\'t bother me right now and after looking into it, it seems there\'s easy ways to get around this.

Even though my old machine still works wonderful, I thought, it\'s a good deal, why not update it to match my cute new kitchenaid mixer? Well, first thing that bothered me taking it out of the box was how cheap this one feels. The bottom tray is light and cheap feeling vs the metal one on my older model. The reservoir where the water goes is apparently so sensitive. I had distilled bottle water poured in there, which apparently it didn\'t like because it wouldn\'t set the sensor off, so it kept telling me to \"add water please\" until I dumped out my bottled water and put in sink water. (Our sink water doesn\'t taste so fancy, but it made it work.) Well then as it chugged along and brewed my coffee, it was a splashy mess. I mean I get it, but there was so much that splashed it was like, for real? Maybe if I had a black one, whatever I could get away with cleaning it whenever, but the light blue color shows it all. And who wants to wash off their keurig after every cup? My old one didnt do this. The water reservoir is awkward. I have it under my cabinets on a pod storage stand thing, but the tank is in the back where it\'s awkward to pull it out and fill it up. It\'s like I gotta move the whole thing to get water in it. And the whole top lid comes off, vs my older model, it\'s just an uncomfortable shape. Also doesnt snap on or feel secure. Just kind of sits on top.  I had to refill it after one brew. Compared to my older model, I thought itd be nice to have a more \"slim\" one, but its really not even much smaller. It takes up the same amount of space, if not more because you gotta move the whole thing just to get water in it. The screen is user friendly and easy to understand, but unless I cant figure it out, it doesnt have a clock to tell you the time? Overall, I would spend the few more dollars and get the bigger model. My parents have that one, so I thought this one would compare but nah. At the end of the day, it brews coffee, what it\'s supposed to do, but it\'s cheapy feeling for a \"nice\" coffee maker. It\'s a cute color, and is very pretty. But we like coffee in my house and although it\'s an \"update\", it feels more like a downgrade everywhere else wise.'),

I started getting the \'Brew interrupted, needle under pressure\' error message after a couple of weeks of use, but would be ok after I went through the whole cleaning process. Then it started happening more frequently, then daily. So I called the 888 number. Customer service was great after I explained that I did everything Google told me to do to fix the problem. The good news was they\'d send me a new one out, bad news no Teal. No biggie. Receive a Pearl White one and very first time using it, get the same error.

I\'ve always loved Keurigs since the first time I used one, but I was hesitant to purchase because I don\'t have a lot of counter space. The K250 is perfect! The smaller water tank makes the unit much slimmer and I can squeeze it back in a corner of the counter. I actually like the small tank better because it forces me to use fresh water. And the color is fantastic! Every morning when I look at the turquoise machine, it makes me even happier than I already am to get my delicious, fresh cup of coffee. Though it can brew the carafe-sized pods, it does not come with an actual carafe, so this keeps the cost down. And I love the settings on the 2.0 system that allow for a 4 oz, 6 oz, 8 oz, or 10 oz brew, and you can even select to brew it \"strong.\" The quality of the brewed coffee is great.

However, I am extremely disappointed that the system advertised 9 brew sizes but in fact only brews 4-,6-, 8- or 10 oz. sizes. I have 14 oz travel mugs and I have to brew 2 times to get a full mug. My coffee mugs are all large and again I have to brew 2 times to get a full mug of coffee or 3 times to get a full mug for tea as the hot water only brews 4 or 6 oz sizes. Who drinks only 4 or 6 oz of tea??? I also do not like the fact that I cannot use a reusable pod. I miss my custom blends of the seasons and my freshly ground beans. I wish I never spent the money on this. I am going to resurrect my old one - I haven\'t tossed it yet - and it still brewed better than this model. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED KEURIG!

I have only had the second one for one week before getting the same message. \"Water under pressure\" when I carefully open it and remove the pod and close the machine, hot water spits out everywhere. I only use Their brand cups and only make one cup a day. I spoke to the company again. They walked me through three \"repair/ maintenance\" procedures. It still doesn\'t work. I will be returning this for a full refund. After being up all night with a little one, the last thing I want to do is fight with the coffee maker and be on only for 45 minutes with keurig.

Mostly the ability to set a timer and have it turn on by itself in the morning and also the temperature adjustment.  I also was under the impression that it came with a Carafe. It does not. I guess I should have read the fine print. It does show one in the pictures describing it though. And it\'s not exactly cheap. About $30. Considering that\'s almost half of what I paid for the Keurig itself, that\'s quite a bit.  Overall good product, but I would say this is a simpler model.'),

The coffee is smooth and rich, not grainy and too strong. The downside about the product is it\'s a little too fancy for me. It\'s not a bad thing, but I think having a touch screen on a coffee maker is a bit extreme.'),

However, my one issue with it was that it only accepts K-cups produced after a certain date (since a year or two ago).

It feels like I need to refill the water more often and it will take in a lot of water when preheating. Also, I can\'t figure out how to turn it off so I end up just unplugging it (a digital on button and does not describe on/off in the manual).

The only issue I have with this brewer is the fact that it doesn\'t brew EVERY k-cup I have. If it doesn\'t clearly state \"Keurig\" around the outside of the k-cup, it will not work in this brewer. You will get a message on the display reading \"Oops...this cup will not work in this brewer.\" Luckily I still have the other brewer and put those cups in that one. Keurig does give you the option of sending them in and they will replace those k-cups, but I\'d rather just use them up with the other brewer. Overall I\'m very happy with my purchase!

The size of this brewer is wonderful, not to mention it doesn\'t humm loudly like the old one did. Also the touch screen is pretty cool looking! Only complaint is that this brewer requires that you use only Keurig K Cups, so that means no ground coffee in the reusable cup.

I have one of the older versions of a Keurig and that one works well, but this one is awesome. The best feature would have to be the touch screen. I mean does it get any better than that? It\'s pretty cool. I love how it also can make up to 4 cups of coffee. I\'ve always used just my regular coffee maker to make more than one cup of coffee. Now, it\'s convenient that Keurig has come out with this product. It also makes the coffee a lot quicker. The machine is silent when brewing which is nice. Another plus is that you can fill it with a lot more water than previous Keurigs and you can stick a water filter in there.

The OOPS message came up with 4 of the pods we tried..all different varities but usable in Keurigs. I decided to call the customer service # on the screen & they were quick to fix the problem. It seems that this Keurig pot is equipped with a laser to read the top of the pods & the pods we had were not newer pods.

For those on the go this is great for fast-paced mornings, it is also easy to use and it\'s touch screen gives you step by step directions.

Also, you can program it to have a cup or carafe of your favorite coffee or tea waiting on you in the morning, afternoon, or evening. But you can also tell it it what kind of brew you want. It gives an option for a \"strong brew\", for those of you that like coffee that feels like a good morning slap in the face. What makes it special is, it\'s just so incredibly easy to you. It has a detachable water dispenser, so you doing have to play, try not to get a electrocuted. But it\'s good for any household, because each individual person, can have their favorite cup of coffee in under 3 minutes. It\'s good for someone on the go, or someone who likes to have their beverages at their leisure. But with an, \'on the go\' brewing speed. I\'ve always wanted one, I\'ve always wondered if it was all it was cracked up to be? It totally is. Why spend close to the same amount on something basic, when you can have something special. Keurig 2.0 is definitely special. And now that I use the K-Pods, I do see them in more and more grocery stores. So you don\'t HAVE to order everything online, but you can if you wanted to.'),

It\'s quiet and fast, and I LOVE the option for hot water (those with a previous 2.0 brewer will know what a big deal this is, you used to have to hold down the brew button and it might spit out a couple of ounces at a time!) Pros: -compact, quiet, easy to use, comes with a cleaning piece and descaling solution Cons: -no auto-off feature (and you have to hold down the power button for a bit for it to turn off, you can\'t just push and release) -reservoir is on the back of the machine, not the side, and a bit tricky to get it to seat properly until you get used to how it fits on there. If you\'re putting the machine under an upper cabinet in the kitchen, it\'ll be harder to fill the reservoir than other models Overall, I\'m really happy I received this machine in exchange for my review, and think it\'ll be perfect for small kitchens (or those that want to take up less space on their counters) and we\'re definitely taking it on vacation with us!'),

This one was a decent price and had lots of fun color choices! I love how it brews and has an easy-to-use touch screen. The one problem I have with it (and I didn\'t understand or realize this when I bought it), is that you can\'t use certain K-cups in it. I have a BUNCH of coffee and tea products that I can\'t use in this because they don\'t have the check mark on them, but they are still a Keurig product! I wrote to them about it and their solution was \"give them to someone that can still use them in their brewer\". Well, for one thing, I paid good money for those and I don\'t feel like just giving away all my coffee and tea and I don\'t know anyone nearby that I can give them too. They did try and compensate by giving me two free boxes of coffee/tea with the purchase of two boxes. The trouble with that is they give you the same promotion code as when you bought the machine and you can\'t use it twice. Instead, of giving such bad advice and a code that you can\'t use, maybe they should give you a free reusable K-cup coffee filter that can work in the 2.0, because my old ones don\'t work in here either. While its a really nice brewer, I feel like I have to re-buy everything I already have! Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.'),

It is SUPER easy to set up, quick to brew and quiet. The little touch screen gives clear step by step instructions on what to do next which is great. K-cups came with the Keurig which was amazing since I didn\'t have any just laying around but wanted to try it right away! My first cup was English Breakfast Tea. I\'m not a huge coffee drinker so tea is my preferable option and this tea was amazing. Fresh. It took me back to my first encounter with Breakfast Tea on my trip to Ireland a few years back. It is now my special treat on the mornings that the kids actually sleep in a little and I have some (rare) time for myself. I have even tried several of the coffee blends and they are very good! They are fresh and of higher quality. I prefer my coffee brewed over ice so I froze some of my favorite creamer and brewed it right over those cubes and it was amazing! It has me so excited for the warmer weather that is coming as it will replace my morning cup of hot tea. My husband has jumped right on the coffee train with me and drinks a LOT more of it than I do and is absolutely loving the Keurig .It\'s easy to make and maintain and no clean up after it\'s brewed right in to your cup! His one word after his first sip was, delicious. So all in all - 5 stars for the Keurig 2.0 machine itself as it is sleek, modern, and perfect for a home kitchen counter. I\'ve yet to read on other special things it can do but for the morning cup of coffee - it\'s perfect! I\'m excited to play with new settings and recipes and see just exactly all of the things that it will have to offer. I\'ve seen recipes for oatmeal, soups and more and I can\'t wait to try them out! The k-cups they sent with it are fantastic. There is quite the variety to choose from and each one I\'ve had so far is supper yummy! I\'m excited about expanding what I already know is going to be my k-cup collection and even learning about how to re-purpose the cups and grounds and make every little bit count!

The brewer has only one coord and \"installation\" is very simple. When you turn the brewer on, it begins a preheating stage which may bother a few as it takes anywhere from 30-60 seconds. Then you select the strength of your coffee and size and the brewing begins almost immediately. In comparison to previous versions, I believe this version is much easier to use, it feels faster, and is easy to clean and maintain. Noise levels are tolerable and the touch display is convenient. The new water tank is convenient for such a small sized Keurig in that I don\'t have to add 8 ounces of water to my Keurig each time I want a cup of coffee. With that being said, I feel that the primary flaw, as with all Keurigs is that whenever the water falls down to a certain level in the tank, you can no longer have a cup of coffee, tea, etc. You must have it filled to a certain unmarked point in the water tank to have coffee. Not a big deal but I wish the water could all be used before having to add more water.

We love the fact that we can enjoy coffee shop type drink at a fraction of the price and do not have to drive the fifteen miles to get them. My husband is THRILLED with our Keurig and I am as well. Easy to use, great selection, and quick. If we were able to use any brand K cups and it came with the carafe I would have given it the full five stars.'),

After trying the Keurig K250*, I\'d be lying if I said that I could ever see myself going back to my old coffeemaker! PROS: This has been so easy to use. The machine heats up quickly and makes a nice HOT cup of coffee. My old maker didn\'t even spit out coffee this hot, so it\'s nice to get coffee at the temperature it should be. Since I started using the Keurig, I\'ve also learned that I\'ve never made a proper cup of coffee. I would sleepily stumble to my coffeemaker, dump a little coffee in the filter and turn it on. Then, I\'d dump half a cup of creamer into it just to cover up the flavor, which was different every time. I love that the Keurig takes the guess out of measuring. I get a great tasting cup of coffee every time. I\'ve even discovered that I LOVE my coffee without creamer. French Roasts and Hazelnuts not only smell great, but they taste divine now too! I can get a few days of use out of the machine before it reminds me that I need to add more water. It\'s a little annoying, but with my old maker, I had to fill it every day, so that\'s just me being lazy. haha CONS: No, major cons. I didn\'t really find too much that I didn\'t like about the machine. It is a little noisy. Nothing super loud, but louder than my old maker and I do worry that it will wake up the kiddo if I\'m trying to brew a cup during naptime since their bedroom is right off the kitchen. It was a lot bigger than my old machine and does take up a good amount of space in our tiny apartment kitchen. It\'s not the largest machine in the world, but I\'m not sure if I would recommend it for apartment/dorm living or for anyone who had little counter space. I wish it had a clock/timer function like my old maker, but that\'s nothing that would keep me from purchasing this machine. It is true that this machine can ONLY use the 2.0 K-cups with the special white ring on them. There are plenty of ways around this, but the simplest solution is just to buy a 2.0 reusable k-cup. They\'re easily accessible for purchase in most stores. I picked one up and have been using it for weeks, without issue, in my K250 2.0 brewer. Overall, I\'m very glad that I got the chance to try this machine out for myself. The pros definitely outweigh the cons, and I would recommend this machine.

The K250 seems to be well-made, so I don\'t expect any such problems with it.

I have soaked all removable parts (water reservoir, k-cup holder, etc) in white vineagar over night, spent an hour running white vinegar and water cleanses through the machine, and I even washed all the removable parts in the dishwasher (something you\'re not supposed to do but it was my last resort).

It does take a few minutes for the machine to warm up, but then once you place a Keurig cup in the machine it brews quickly.  If you purchase the regular Keruig cups the maximum size offered is 10 oz. So if you like more per serving you will have to purchase the K-mug. The machine reads the cups electronically, so you can\'t overide the size for the Keurig cups.   The other benefits to this maching is K-cafare option. You do have to purchase the pot separately (for $20),  but it is awesome feature if you are going to have company over.    I have been using the machine for only about 2 weeks, so I haven\'t had the opportunity to clean it. However, Keurig has conviently provided a special instrument to clean the needle in the machine.  I truly recommend this Keurig especially if you have never owned one. It has 3 features in one:  hot water dispenser, k-cup and k-carafe. You can\'t beat it for the price!!!'),

It is much faster than my old keurig and I love the setting adjustments so I can make my single cup nice and strong!!

I was ecstatic once I received the 2.0- I have always been \"behind the times\" on technology, so this was a great chance to upgrade to a better Keurig system. I absolutely LOVE coffee, I can\'t get enough! Iced, hot, lattes, you name it, I\'ll drink it. My first impression of this system was how beautiful the design is! My other brewer had the water reservoir on the side, I love that this once has one on the back, and it\'s much larger, so I don\'t have to refill it after only a couple cups. I also love that the design fits in nicely with my other black kitchen appliances. Once out of the box, it was easy to assemble and get her all set up. This newer brewer doesn\'t have that plastic taste or smell from the factory like some of the older brewers do, so that is a plus! I popped in my first K-Cup and I was ready to enjoy a hot cup of delicious coffee! Since I had been using a Keurig for years, of course I had tons of K-Cups in stock. I ran into the problem with the new system not recognizing the older K-Cups. I think I heard there is a fitted piece you can install to get the Keurig to recognize the older cups, I haven\'t tried that yet. Honestly, this isn\'t a problem for me because there are so many cups available on the market. I did wish the box came with the carafe it boasts, Im not sure where to purchase the carafe or the K-Cups to use it, but I am definitely interested in trying that! I highly recommend this brewer to anyone who enjoys a fast on-the-run great cup of coffee, or to anyone who likes to sip while reading a good book.

There was a problem, however, and after 3 days of dealing with it, I had to take it back and exchange it for a Keurig Classic machine. I had owned a Classic and it gave me dependable service for about 3 1/2 years. I should have stuck with that model. With this new model, it seems about every 3rd or 4th cup we brewed, we not only got a cup of coffee, but we got a cup full of grounds spilling over from the K-Cup into our coffee. This was a brand new machine, and we read and followed the instruction booklet to the letter. We did not overfill the water tank. We tried securely placing the K-Cup into the holder, and we also tried just loosely placing the cup in the holder. Made no diference. We also used fresh filtered water. With each mishap, I disassembled and rinsed the cup holder, then ran a cleansing brew of plain water to make sure all grains were cleared. It never failed to happen again at some point, and after 3 frustrating mornings of dealing with it, I gave up and exchanged it out for the classic. I am hoping for a much better performance tomorrow morning.'),
(8438, 13, 2, 5, '2015-08-24', 'My Little Sandy Pearl <3 I�۪ve now had my Keurig for two weeks, and I LOVE IT! This is my first Keurig, but I�۪ve used one before (my mother has had one for four or five years). I�۪m a college student living at home, and I have to wake up very early in the morning, so I�۪m usually in a hurry to get out the door. I have the Sandy Pearl color, and let me tell you, it looks absolutely beautiful in my room! (I love the ability to pick from many colors!) I would�۪ve chosen Turquoise, but I�۪m hoping to take this with me to my apartment after I graduate, so I chose a neutral color. The heat up, in my opinion, is very quick. I plug my Keurig in, and it begins heating while I start getting ready. Once the sound stops, I put in my favorite cup or use a re-fillable cup and place a tea bag inside. There are many sizes and custom brewing options, which is great because I have so many different kinds of cups and mugs. Some only can hold 4-6oz. and others can hold 10oz. or more. I love the touch screen���It�۪s elegant AND easy! While heating and brewing make a decent amount of noise, it�۪s much quieter than the one my mother has. My little sister�۪s room is adjacent to mine, and it�۪s never woke her up yet! The beverages are always extremely hot, which is great, considering that some days my cup sits there a while before I�۪m ready to grab it, and I think that attributes to how well it brews bags of tea. I�۪ve been pleasantly surprised with how much flavor of tea has made it into my mug without steeping. Now for the cons��_ There aren�۪t many, but the ones it has, I feel, are pretty important. 1) Several of my travel mugs cannot fit under it (and yes, that is with the tray removed). My solution has been to place a different, smaller cup underneath the Keurig and transfer it into my travel cup afterwards. It�۪s a nuisance, but it works. Luckily, for me, I don�۪t use travel mugs every day, so it�۪s not that big of a deal. 2) There�۪s no auto-off feature. This is the biggest frustration for me. I have to unplug my Keurig after every use to conserve energy. One day I left it on and noticed it DID turn off, BUT then I did the same experiment two other days and it stayed on all day long��_ (10+ hours) All in all, I�۪m extremely satisfied with my purchase. The cons are nothing that can�۪t be fixed with a few extra steps on my end, which in the end, doesn�۪t matter as much. This little thing is still faster and easier than stopping by the coffee shop or boiling hot water on the stove for tea. Love this little gem!  **Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review!**  (For those wondering about the free pods... Keurig sent me an email a couple weeks after registering my Keurig explaining this promotion. So don\'t forget to register!!)'),

I also live in an apartment with limited counter space, so when I purchased my Keurig Mini I was very excited. I LOVED my mini, have had it for YEARS, brewed a fantastic cup of coffee whenever I wanted it. My boyfriend moved in and we used the mini more often, and his travel mug is bigger so we used to brew two cups to fill it, he also likes a stronger brew, and well the mini - after years of use just didn\'t keep up and broke down (I think I actually shed a tear). So, we purchased a K250 - set it up, swapped the toaster oven for a toaster because of the space, and well ... it looks pretty. Despite the 9 brew sizes it claims to brew (HUGE draw to this machine), the bigger machine doesn\'t really brew anything more that the mini did. Evidently it\'s a standard 4 size (and the 10oz is actually less that the 10oz my mini brewed), it\'s not stronger, not even when you press the strong button, there\'s no auto shut off, additional 3 sizes are available but only if you buy the KMug (and only 9 varieties available), and the rest are for the carafe (but only for cup portions), so the 9 brew sizes aren\'t truly available... The strong brew tastes more like water poured over ground up beans than it does a good cup of coffee. We\'re waiting upwards of ten minutes for the machine to warm up each morning, and overall just disappointed. Worst money on a Keurig spent and zero benefits ...'),

I frequently drink more than one cup on the weekends and days I work from home and this is an exciting feature for me. I also like the setting that I can make it stronger. This feature has been used often. Lastly, I don\'t like it has a filter that requires changes after a certain number of uses.

(8469, 13, 2, 5, '2015-04-11', 'Pros + Conts The Keurig 2.0 is DEFINITELY an update from the old-fashioned (haha) one. Here is a list of the pros (and very few cons) of the Keurig 2.0: Pros: Screen that tells you what is going on. This is AWESOME for someone who is impatient and skeptical, like me. If it weren\'t for the screen on the new Keurig 2.0 telling me that it was preheating, I might go into a panic, wondering if I did something wrong. And it is is touch screen. This is awesome. Water amount options. Via the touch screen you can select four (I think the old Keurig machines only had 3) different pour options: 4 oz (for super-strong), 6 oz, 8 oz, 10 oz. I, a coffee fiend, went for the strong-ish 6 oz pour. Add hot water option. Turns out that the 6 oz pour did not fill my mug enough, so I was was pleased that there was an option to add just hot water to your cup. Even after adding hot water my cup of coffee was still really good and strong. I was honestly impressed with the Keurig coffee. Descaling solution. The machine came with descaling solution, which is great because if you want your coffee machine to last, you need to descale it often. A bunch of free pods. The Keurig 2.0 came with a bunch (I think ~30) free pods in all different varieties. Very generous of them! My husband even tried the tea and liked it. Very sleek and compact. This machine looks great on the counter in our small, seminary-housing apartment. It fit in the place I usually keep my blender (which means it is very compact). It fit well below our cabinets, as well. Instruction manual in multiple languages and has lots of good info. Including giving you information about recycling K-cups. And��_perhaps my favorite: it is polite. This Keurig is noticeably polite! It says \"Welcome\", \"Please\", \"Enjoy\"��_ etc. Very polite programing, thank you very much. Less dishes. At the end of the day, all you have to clean is your mug. Cons: No Carafe. I was excited about the coffee pot feature of the Keurig 2.0, which will be great when we have guests over. However the Carafe is sold separately, which kind of disappointed me. Froze. Because it is now run by a more complicated computer (because of the touch screen, etc.) this means there is more room for bugs. My machine got caught in a loop and was stuck \"preheating\" for about 10 minutes before I realized it was not really preheating. At that point I unplugged the machine to give it a restart. When I plugged it back in it started reheating right away. So, as you can see, there are very few cons and lots of pros! I will consider giving this as a gift for some upcoming weddings! The product is great.'),

But that\'s what makes it sleeker in its design.  I used to be able to place it underneath my cupboard . Once you turn on the k200 it brews hot coffee then when you are done with that cup it heats up the water for the next brew which is the part that I don\'t really like . The brewer stays on and I wouldnt use it until the next few hours. Once I do brew a cup it wouldn\'t brew the coffee as hot. But it\'s not so much a big deal. I still enjoy my coffee .

(8533, 13, 2, 5, '2015-05-12', 'In love with my first Keurig!! I use my beautiful new Keurig 2.0 k250 everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. My drink of choice is the sweet and creamy donut house brew over ice (so good). This is my first Keurig, as I was always skeptical about brewing just 1 cup in a limited size. I previously used a traditional coffee maker to make a pot at a time. I was very impressed that I am able to fit my tall 24oz tumbler without issue and my even larger 32oz mason jar style tumbler with a little modification. I have not yet purchased the carafe, but I plan to do so in future for when we have company. Although, we had several guests over and I made 5 individual cups in a row and the machine never skipped a beat! And so fast too!! The 40oz water resevior is great! I would say the only con for me, is that I was expecting it to be a little more compact. The design is very sleek, and the machine is narrow, but I still feel it takes up as much room as a traditional brewer. We have a very small kitchen, so my K250 currently resides on a shelving unit rather than the counter. It is a great product I have and would continue to recommend to a friend.'),

At first I was doubtful of the purchase not because of the machine but because I didn\'t want to be buying the expensive keurig k cups. Luckily I found k cups that work with machine at ALDI. These k cups from Aldi are less than $4 for 12 k cups and there are in different flavors like Colombian, donut store, breakfast blend, etc. I also bought a reusable cup to put in my coffee but I would just rather pop a k cup. By using the k cups from ALDI I don\'t worry about making a mess or cleaning the reusable k cup, just insert, brew and toss the k cups.'),

It does take a few moments to heat up, but it\'s relatively quiet and produces a steady stream of beverage. The only things I don\'t care for is there are only two cup size options (4 oz and 6 oz) for the hot water, yet there are three sizes for K-cup pods (6 oz, 8 oz, and 10 oz). If I want 10 oz of water, I have to run both the 4 oz and the 6 oz. Also, sometimes it doesn\'t fill the mug as much as I think it should.

Took it back and exchanged ut but had the same problem immediately. This time we called Kuerig and they agreed to replace the pot. We received the new pot todat (our 3rd) and we still get grinds. Called customer service and they are sending us another pot (#4) however i would prefer a refund but since we didnt but it from their website they cannot give us a refund.

I have to sometimes fall back on my old school drip coffee maker on super cold mornings for a really hot cup. Also, I\'ve wasted quite a few new pods because the machine does not recognize it.

So I sit here and wonder, do I need to install one of these puppies, or do I have two spares?.. hmnm. Additonally, there like 3 or 4 sets of individual instructions between the maker itself and some of the accessories rather than all included in the main manual. Its like they spent the whole budget on a nice-looking coffee maker and then phoned in the important parts of the consumer experience. What a nice downer before I even make the first cup. I am not sure if I have it assembled correctly or if the important water filter is preinstalled.

Now we have this version, and are impressed with the upgrades and better features than the original model. Pros: Quiet-so much quieter than the first version. Lots more options when brewing. You can opt for a \"strong\" brew, change the amount of water used, or (my favorite) just heat water! Love that feature for brewing tea. This version has a carafe that you can fill with using special pods. I\'d love to try this out for brewing a large quantity, but it was not included with my package. This version is also smaller than the original. Love that saved counter space. I love that you can descale your machine. We had the original version of the Keurig and this was not something that was mentioned/recommended (if I remember right). Such a great way to keep your machine running great. Cons: The water chamber signals needing to be refilled when it still has 1/3 of the water left in it. At our house, my husband and I drink multiple cups of coffee each day, so it needs to be refilled frequently. The coffee is not equal to a strong cup you\'d get from an espresso machine (which is what we use to make coffee prior to getting this Keurig.) But, if you like coffee, don\'t need a crazy strong brew (even with the strong feature), this machine is quiet, easy to clean, and easy peasy to use.

We have the 2.0, and love all of the new features! Pros: Quiet-so much quieter than the first version. Lots more options when brewing. You can opt for a \"strong\" brew, change the amount of water used, or (my favorite) just heat water! Love that feature for brewing tea. This version has a carafe that you can fill with using special pods. I\'d love to try this out for brewing a large quantity of coffee, but it was not included with my package. I love that you can descale your machine. We had the original version of the Keurig and this was not something that was mentioned/recommended (if I remember right). Such a great way to keep your machine running great. Cons: The water chamber signals needing to be refilled when it still has 1/3 of the water left in it. At our house, my husband and I drink multiple cups of coffee each day, so it needs to be refilled frequently. The coffee is not equal to a strong cup you\'d get from an espresso machine (which is what we used to make coffee prior to getting this Keurig.) But, if you like coffee, don\'t need a crazy strong brew (even using the strong feature), this machine is quiet, easy to clean, and easy peasy to use.

Originally it was called the K250 and they changed the name to the K200. Due to the change they no longer give you the free coffee samples which is fine. It took them 4 months to finally get me the correct water filter kit. With this order I received a water filter but they left out the 2 free cartridges and they left out the descaling solution. As far as I\'m concerned when you replace something it should be the entire kit as advertised. Also when I registered this brewer I was told I would receive another email with a coupon good for 2 boxes of coffee when you purchase 2 boxes with free shipping which they didn\'tdo. The first brewer didn\'t have the water filter kit and it took them 4 months to get one by them sending me a second brewer replacement kit. This second one was missing the drp tray so I had to keep the original from the first brewer. The 2nd brewer also had a crack in the plastic resorvior so I had to keep the one that came with the first brewer. So then they sent me a third brwer but they were out of the black and I wasn\'t told that was just temporary so I had to pick another color which was hidious if you\'re a guy. 2 days later when I wrote the review I received a call saying they could send the black one and this one works but my opinion is whether it\'s a replacement or not, everything that is supposed to come with the K250(K200) should still come with it. Last of all when I registered this brewer I was told specifically by the representative I would receive a coupon good for 2 free boxes of coffee when you purchase 2 by email even though it was a replacement.

Lower portion of brewer lifts out for easy cleaning. Unit has easy to understand and program panel. Our brewer appears to be well built and should last quite awhile with little maintenance as our old system has. Brewed our first 2 cups and thought the temperature and strength of the coffee was very good. One thing we noticed is how quiet it is compared with our older brewer. My wife is thinking of swapping out the 2 and making this our primary system. Yes, Keurig is sending me a couple boxes of pods for this review. But that does not mater. If you open our cupboard above the brewer you will find around 50 boxes of pods. Everytime we think we have settled on one coffee we try another and then find we like that one also.

I wish that there would have been some sort of disclaimer on it because that would have possibly changed my mind about buying it.

I use my new Keurig everyday. I love the fact that I can brew various size beverages with the touch of a button. I like to emphasize that it\'s a button because my last model had no buttons; you just filled the reservoir appropriately. The sleek new design is also a huge plus. I have a black model and it makes a great addition to my modern looking kitchen. The fact that the water reservoir can hold a decent amount of water is another plus. I live with a few other roommates (I just graduated from college) and they all use it also. We don\'t have to worry about filling it after or before each use.

We are retired & on a fixed income. There is no way we can afford this. The machine WILL be returned, unless there are other possibilities.

The water reservoir is removable and easy to clean which was a previous issue with the Keurig Mini because the water reservoir for the Mini is non-removable. This makes it hard to clean especially with mineralization. Since I am an everyday coffee drinker and am now addicted to caffeine, I was pleasantly surprised when there was a \"strong\" setting. It also has setting for \"Hot Cocoa\" and other which I was also surprised by. Definitely going to purchase some other types of Kcups because of that. In comparison to the Mini, the clearance for cup sizes is more versatile. The Mini can really only accommodate short mugs while I can fit my tall thermos under K250. Overall, it\'s a little bigger than the Keurig Mini but it\'s size is fair in terms of brewing systems. I currently have the black one and it looks great on the countertop. Nothing too flashy.

If you use a normal sized kcup you only have 6oz, 8oz, or 10oz to choose from on the screen. Thus you can\'t brew a larger cup of coffee from normal sized pod as you can with lesser models. I also received an error message on a random folgers kcup saying it was a knock off and couldn\'t be brewed.

Yes, the K-cups are a little pricey, but it\'s worth it to me.  The Keurig web site offers sample packs of cups so you can try out new flavors before you buy an expensive full sized box.

The motor was also very loud. I called keurig support and they said that over time it would get quieter, but this was just not good for me. It still brewed just fine and the coffee was good.

I bought a second Kuerig and it has an awful plastic taste that will not go away. I have read many reviews and find this is quite common with the 2.0.

The system is really easy to us and easy to clean. I have had no problems with it at all. My only beef with this system is that I have to fill the reservoir, it seems, like every other day.

I choose sand and it looks really nice on the counter just sitting there. Coffee tastes great.  I also picked up a reusable filter basket and 4 cup crafe so I can use regular non pod coffee as well.

Not sure why it gave that message, but as soon as we put a k-cup that was purchased recently it worked just fine. Also, be aware that the first couple cups of coffee, tea, cocoa, etc. will taste like plastic. The easiest way around that is running hot water through it quite a few times.

The brew size does depend on if you\'re using a cup, mug, or carafe pod (K-cup only goes up to 10oz) however you could do 6oz and 6oz to get a 12oz size, 10oz then 4oz for 14oz, or 10oz and 6oz for a 16oz for the K-cups to get a larger size. Personally I prefer the 10oz K-cup as I like to have room to add cream and sugar or whipped cream without worrying about anything spilling over. Although older K-cups won\'t work in the newer brewers, you could solve the problem by using an accessory like 2.0 My K-Cup to put the older K-cup\'s coffee in or find an equivalent coffee in one of the newer K-cups. So far, I haven\'t had any trouble with coffee grounds in my cup or water spilling into the tray, but I did check my cup sizes first and I wait patiently for it to finish completely. It\'s quite new so I haven\'t had to change the filter or descale yet. I like how the instruction manual covers everything and has a problem solving guide in easy steps. Really the only trouble can be the total cost, as accessories such as the carafe ($20-$30) and 2.0 My K-cup ($15) are not included, as well as storage for the pods ($25-$30), although the cost of the coffee for the maker is much cheaper than the amount I was spending (generally less than $1 per K-cup versus about $5 for one 14-16oz cup). All in all, I\'m very happy with my new (turquoise) Keurig coffee maker!'),

I stop by Dunkin Donuts every morning to pick myself up a Medium HOT Latte. Well let me JUST SAY��_NOT ANYMORE. Go pick yourself up Keurig 2.0 immediately! Some may think I am crazy but I brought my Keurig 2.0 to work to share with my co-workers. I also purchased the reusable pod so I can pack whatever coffee I like versus buying the pods. Compare my $3+ daily run from Dunkin or getting a box of 12 pods for $8.00 which equals out to .67 cents a day��_which route would you choose? Honestly speaking, I was so used to Dunkin Donuts that I thought I liked it! Well after taking a week break from Dunkin and then picking one up on the way home one afternoon (It was a long day at work) I was so unhappy. I needed my coffee from my Keurig. I have seen and read reviews about the old K-Cups not working on the 2.0 versions. I have not had an issue. I bought my reusable pod but I have also used K-Cups from the 1.0 and it worked just as fine on the 2.0. I love this Coffee Machine and I am looking forward to purchasing another one.

Now we have this version, and are impressed with the upgrades and better features than the original model. Pros: Quiet���so much quieter than the first version. Lots more options when brewing. You can opt for a \"strong\" brew, change the amount of water used, or (my favorite) just heat water! Love that feature for brewing tea. This version has a carafe that you can fill with using special pods. I\'d love to try this out for brewing a large quantity, but it was not included with my package. This version is also smaller than the original. Love that saved counter space. I love that you can descale your machine. We had the original version of the Keurig and this was not something that was mentioned/recommended (if I remember right). Such a great way to keep your machine running great. Cons: The water chamber signals needing to be refilled when it still has 1/3 of the water left in it. At our house, my husband and I drink multiple cups of coffee each day, so it needs to be refilled frequently. The coffee is not equal to a strong cup you\'d get from an espresso machine (which is what we use to make coffee prior to getting this Keurig.) But, if you like coffee, don\'t need a crazy strong brew (even with the strong feature), this machine is quiet, easy to clean, and easy peasy to use.

I drink no more than 3 cups a day and this thing has been failing to work as advertised since month 2. My personal favorite is the completely white screen that doesn\'t allow you to do ANYTHING., and Keurig\'s helpful response? Please unplug and \"hopefully that will solve the problem\" and the good news is that it does for about 3 cups of coffee. Oh, and sometimes even unplugging it does not work. On top of that, the reliability of the machine is about 20%, each day is a new adventure on what won\'t work on this machine. Some days it takes (no exaggeration) 20minutes to \"preheat\" , and at least once a week it won\'t produce a full cup of coffee (no matter how often or well you use their little unclogger thing). Add to this you can\'t use any pods except those made by/for Keurig and that you can\'t dispense more than 6 oz of hot water at a time (go hang, tea drinkers!) and that the water filter required is an extra 20 bucks, and what you have is an overpriced trashcan ornament. Keruig, complete fail. I\'ll be taking my business elsewhere. Between the lousy equipment and your lackluster\"customer service\" I\'ll never purchase a Keurig product again. Happy New Year to me. *Note: I\'d have used stronger language about my disgust for the machine and Keurig\'s customer service, but the site won\'t even allow it. Have no doubt, this is the worst piece of equipment I\'ve run across. Don\'t waste your time, money and save keep your hair in your head where it belongs.'),

I read every single review on this which was probably the best and worst thing I did because some of these reviews were harsh and seriously convinced me not to purchase this. I was too excited for the keurig that I had to just experience it myself.  So, this coffee machine is amazing. It makes a delicious cup of coffee but You CAN NOT use pods that are not k-pods but there is a hack for it if you go online, (If this is a problem for you then just invest in a different coffee maker) However you can use your own ground coffee if you purchase the reusable pod, which I bought at target as well(It\'s a purple one). I LOVE THIS because I like buying my own ground coffee and you save a lot of money. (1 lb of coffee is approx 46 cups if you do 2 tbls for every 6 oz of water).  It has an option for strong coffee and hot cocoa which is pretty cool. Also, you can do a carafe :D yes a whole carafe!!! The only bummer is that It is sold separately ($20.00) :( and they are very limited on flavors but not to worry you can also buy a reusable pod for it.

The coffee is brewed to drinking temperature - no waiting, blowing, or burnt tongues.    Cons: It\'s probably not a good choice for coffee snobs as it brews quickly and at a lower temperature.  I *am* a tea snob and it definitely does not brew hot enough for a good cup of tea.    The Oasis color does show splatter so often needs a wipe-down after use.

This water reservoir was awkward for our cabinet situation, which we didn\'t take into consideration when we bought the machine, not a fault of the Keurig at all. But, this machine received minimal usage as our cabin was unoccupied for most of the 2 months we owned it. On our next visit to the cabin, the machine began spitting out water, filling cups half way, and then quit working. Thankfully, our guests were not inconvenienced by this faulty product! We\'ve had Keurigs at home and at the office for years, and they\'ve been true workhorses and are still going strong. Our cabin is located in a remote area of Colorado and we had to replace the faulty machine (during an EPIC snow event, even by Colorado standards) with another brand of machine to accommodate incoming guests.

I have one of the original Keurigs and recently bought a 2.0 K550. I received the 2.0 K250 system complimentary to test and review. This smaller system is great. Its very compact so it doesn\'t take up a lot of counter space. This smaller version has a water reservoir which is great instead of needing to pour water in for each cup. The screen walks you through set up and is extremely easy to use. You can select from different cup sizes to strengths and even brew a carafe. This also came with a ton of K-Cups to try, the descaling cleaner and the Keurig maintenance tool. I have noticed with these new 2.0 systems, especially with my K550 the needles get clogged about every other day and have to be cleaned with the provided tool. One of the things that I was really impressed with is that I have seen several reviews where people didn\'t know they couldn\'t use their existing K-cups with the new 2.0 system.

Judging by info on the outside of the box, stating nine brew sizes, I assumed I would be able to brew a large mug of coffee. Come to find out, Keurig now requires K-Mug pods in brew to get a 12, 14, or 16 oz. much of coffee. Never mind, you can work your way around this by brewing a 10 oz. size and then brewing another 4 oz. using the same regular k-cup. Keurigs are nice as far as being quick to brew, but kind of aggravating that in order to get a full mug of coffee, I have to go out and spend more for the special pods. No thanks.....I\'ll just brew twice and save myself some money.'),

(8870, 13, 2, 4, '2015-04-23', 'Renewed my love of coffee This is a huge improvement over their smaller Keurigs. You can choose more cup sizes and it has the optional Carafe you can buy to make a pot of coffee. It also has a hot water feature and a reservior so you don\'t have to fill it up everytime you want to make coffee. I like how you can have different coffees all the time and not have to worry about using up one bag of coffee before opening another. It is especially handy to have with different coffee drinkers in the house who like different things. The single-serve K Cups also ensure your coffee is always fresh. Though definitely not a deal-breaker, one con is that that I wish you could brew more than 10 oz without having to use the Carafe pods. For instance, 10 oz doesn\'t fill up a large coffee mug or travel mug, and I don\'t want to make a whole pot just for those. Also the product is a little more wasteful than traditional coffee since you are using a disposable K Cup each time, and I\'m not sure if my recycling company wants me throwing in the bin the pods with used coffee grounds in them. However, the Keurig\'s benefits outweigh these concerns, and it has already replaced my old way of making coffee. I find myself drinking coffee/tea more often and at different times of the day than I had before. It brews much faster than my old traditional coffee pot, and the hot water feature makes non-K Cup hot chocolate or tea 10x faster than boiling water on the stove. I cannot review the K Pods or Carafe since I do not own a carafe (yet), but I\'m sure it would still be faster to brew than a traditional pot. Overall, this is a great product, and although I was initially skeptical on its practicality, I can\'t imagine not using it.'),

The K-cups also take up a lot of room regardless of whether you store them on the counter or in a cabinet; and again, if you have limited counter/cabinet space that can be a bit of a problem. When brewing your coffee/tea, the Keurig is a little noisy, but it\'s not terribly loud. The K-cups are convenient, but they are really bad for the environment so you have to take the time to recycle! With that being said, I do have to say that the instructions for the Keurig are super simple to follow, it is really easy to clean, it is really easy to brew your coffee/tea.

I was waiting for the K250 rather than just get another mini because I was reading the features and really wanted bigger cup sizes. First of all if you are using a regular k-cup you only get 4 cup sizes, 4/6/8/10. I was hoping to go to at least 12oz for my bigger mugs. I cannot see a way to do that unless using a carafe. There are very limited options on the screen. I do not have a carafe but presumably when you remove the tray and insert a carafe you get more options? It\'s not a bad looking unit but also if I leave it plugged in like my two older keurigs it does actually stay on with the water heated. I don\'t like that. I don\'t want to have to unplug every time (because I know I will forget) and I feel it dangerous to leave heated all day long. The only advantage I see right now is that I can fit bigger mugs in without having to remove the drip tray - but I can\'t fill them. I am sure the carafe would solve a few of my issues but it doesn\'t come with the K250, you have to purchase it. Looking at the reviews (about not keeping warm) and the pictures I have seen I am not sure a plastic carafe would be worth the extra money.

We bought the Keurig reusable filters not the knock off brand and every once in a while we still get this error. We also get it a lot when there isn\'t a filter in it at all.

I was using another brand before I received this Keurig, and let me tell you: I can taste the difference. This machine brews coffee that tastes smoother, less bitter, and (let\'s face it) better. I don\'t know if this is because of the pod-scanning technology, or if it\'s because the model is superior, but they\'re doing something right. The only thing that I don\'t like about this model is that you can\'t use non-Keurig certified pods, or the reusable pods. If you could, I\'d give the produce five stars!'),

For myself, the price was right, the blender is made of glass, and I was looking for a glass blender. The base isn\'t anything special, but it has a lot of different settings. I was a little bit disappointed when it came with only one blade, which is the blending/smoothie blade. But, I\'ve used it to blend some soup, so the blade is still versatile. I honestly believe that the problems I keep reading about (Won\'t crush ice; Motor blows), are being caused by people overloading it. My husband made some beautiful smoothies with this baby, yesterday... No problems with our blender still (thus far). And who knows... I could be wrong and this could just be a hit or miss product.

The 2.0 is only $20 more, but exceeded my expectations in almost every way. The touch screen is much nicer than I expected, and I love the options it gives.

Since we started using our Keurig we have noticed we are drinking more iced beverages, which is what we would normally purchase a the coffee shop. Some people say the pods are expensive, but when you factor in the round trip drive to the coffee shop , plus the product we buy, we are definitely saving money using the Keurig. That being said, we do wish that you could use other brand Kcups as well. We have found a variety we would love to try, but aren\'t able to. I understand the reasoning behind Keurig making the machine this way, however, the ability to use a variety of k cup brands would make this even more valuable in our household. We do like that there is the ability to brew a carafe rather than a single cup, but don\'t like the fact that we have to purchase the carafe separately at the price of approx. $30. I would definitely recommend this to friends, and family as it\'s a great alternative to the coffee shop, there is a great selection and it\'s quicker than a traditional coffee maker.'),

Cannot beat that! The color is a beautiful mint and it looks perfect in my kitchen. I bought it to replace the mini which does not have a reservoir. It was super easy to set up and I have used it almost every day since, especially in this cold Colorado weather. If I have anything negative to say about it, it\'s that the shape of the machine is a little awkward. It seems like it would be more boxy, but it isn\'t. Not a deal breaker, but not quite as sleek in design as the classic. I have it sitting caddy-corner (sp?) and it compliments the Kitchen Aid mixer I have sitting on my counter. My beverages come out piping hot and I have the option to dispense hot water only.

Every problem that I read in the reviews has a simple solution. For instance, you can use a My K-Cup Filter and use whatever kind of coffee you want. Read several reviews saying how \"selfish\" Keurig is and how limited you are on how you can brew coffee. Just not true! Read that you can\'t brew 10 ounce cups with K-Cups. Again, not true. You can brew 4,6,8, and 10 ounce cups with K-Cups. As for old K-Cups people are complaining about, the only ones that don\'t work are K-Cups from 2014!! If you have K-Cups that old, it\'s time to throw them away anyway. This K200 can do anything that an old machine can do and do it so much better with much more freedom, ease, and variety. This is my second Keurig coffee maker. My first one was the Office Pro from 2011. Loved, loved, loved that machine. It still works great and gave it to a friend when I got my K200 2.0. The K200 makes so many improvements and is so much easier to clean as well. I love how quiet the new machine is and love the water filter too. Pick up any of the new 2.0 machines and you won\'t be disappointed. You\'ll get a good, cup, mug or carafe every time. Have some friends that have the K500 and they absolutely prefer there new machine from their old Keurig machine. Really wanted the K500 model as well but this K200 just fits my limited counter space so much better. I really love Keurig and can\'t even imagine going back to a regular coffee maker. So happy with my purchase and I hope that this K200 brings me the many, many, many days of great coffee and beverages like my Office Pro did for 5 years. Thank you Keurig!!!!'),

All in all I like it. These things I will just have to get used to. I purchased a reusable filter for the 2.0 model, which shoud save some money.

I thought there might be trouble when I opened the box and saw the Brewer Maintenance Accessory. It was a total red flag that indicated there was likely an ongoing problem with the brewers that Keurig is aware of. This also probably explains why it was on sale and included a gift card with purchase. I\'m very disappointed.

So, out with Mr.Coffee and in with Mrs.Keurig :) I have made around 4 cups of coffee today and have been impressed so far. Hopefully I will not be let down. For me this was a pricey purchase. (I\'m not poor, but I\'m not rolling around in the dough either) I have to budget what I do, but I feel this product so far is worth what I have invested. Fingers crossed that I can come back to this site in a year and still rave about this Gorgeous Machine that has taken over my life. Thanks Keurig! :)'),

Did all the usual things that customer service suggests...ran cleaner through it multiple times, cleaned the needle (which wasn\'t plugged), etc. It finally stopped working altogether. Called Keurig and was told they would send me a new brewer...at a small discount. No thanks. The problem with a Keurig is the pump. It malfunctions. So for all those who post reviews like \"I love it!\", come back in a few months and let us know if you still love it.

Our old Keurig broke and so we decided to venture into the world of 2.0. We ordered this one in orange (to my wife\'s joy), and within a week, it was giving us significant grounds in the coffee. We called customer support, went through some tests, and then they sent us new one. We received the new one and within the first or second brew, we had grounds! We went through tests again and to no avail. We asked customer support to send us a different and upgraded Keurig - which they did, and we are within a week of that one. So far, so great. That said, there must be some type of defect with this type of Keurig. I can\'t imagine we received the two totally odd ones in a batch.'),

The 2.0 was a bit complicated to figure out at first but I would definitely recommend this one! I use my Keurig daily, before work and in the morning on the weekend. It\'s quick and easy and each cup is brewed to perfection. I never have to worry about making a cup too strong or weak. I also love that there is an option to brew loose leaf tea.

I am a frequent coffee drinker, and have no desire to use any other brand of coffee other than Keurig brands (the kcup offers all I want, while larger size cups are extremely limited). My issue is that I like to brew more than 10oz with one Kcup. The 2.0 K200 brewer I recently purchased limits the amount you can brew without changing to a different pod, and therefor, it doesn\'t suit my taste like the single-serve mini that I previously used for the past 2 yrs. Even after cleaning and running water through several times, I get a plastic taste on top of the limited ounces. If I can\'t get this resolved, I won\'t be using this system anymore.'),

I use this machine at work in my office five days a week. The coffee has been great tasting and brews very quickly. My only complaint would be that even on the 10oz. size, it doesn\'t fill my cup completely. I know I can buy the larger K-mug sizes, but I was just a bit disappointed that I would need to to fill my cup to the top. That being said, I really like how easy the whole operation is. The main reason I bought this machine was to get away from all the cleaning I had to go through with a normal drip machine. Measuring the coffee, dealing with the grounds, it was just a big pain. The 250 works just like I expected it to. Thinking of getting another one for my wife and I to have at home. Also, I\'ve noticed a quite a few people complain about having to buy the sanctioned K-Cups for the 2.0 machines. My local stores all seem to carry a really good assortment of the correct pods. In fact, I haven\'t seen any for sale that are not the correctly marked variety. Anyway, there are tons to choose from and I\'ve tried about six different ones.'),

We had the Keurig Elite K45 prior too, but the option to do a carafe of coffee was too perfect for us. Grabbed a carafe from a big box store and started to enjoy hot fresh coffee that stayed hot for HOURS. I am not kidding. In the carafe it was at least 4 hours of hot coffee. Too cool! In comparison to the Elite model, this one was definitely lacking in cup sizes, and for the tea drinkers in the office, the 4 oz or 6oz sizes were just too puny in comparison to the coffee sizes you can get from the machine. Sometimes I think it is almost too smart! I have yet to encounter the dreaded Opps! message, but I really do miss being able to use my own coffee in the reusable pods. I really hope that they come out with a compatible pod for that soon! Love how slim it is, and the touch screen. So far it is a great work horse and I am glad to have it!'),

The coffee units provided in condos or hotels is always so bad, that it seemed like a great idea to just carry this and have great coffee. The problem is that you cannot totally eliminate all of the water out of the unit. It holds water somewhere inside and there is not a drain available. So to use it for traveling and have that water sitting there between trips did not seem like a good idea. Sadly took it back and Target credited without a problem.'),

(9021, 13, 2, 4, '2015-07-27', 'Exactly what I wanted Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review. I have never had a Keurig or similar brewing system before this item. I needed a quick and easy way to make coffee before classes (I\'m in college) and this seemed to fit the bill pretty well. I knew several people who have Keurigs and they all seemed to like them so I went ahead and purchased one. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. The Keurig does exactly what it was advertised to do, but unfortunately this model does have a few drawbacks. I find that when going above 8 ounces or so, the coffee tends to taste weaker, which is just a drawback of the system I guess. Also, because of this, there is no option to make 12 or 14 ounces for travel mugs, which I found disappointing. Finally, the new 2.0 models of Keurig requires you to use the Keurig brand cups, which is kind of annoying. This is not too much of a drawback for me, however, because I planned on using the disposable cups anyway. If you are looking for a quick and easy way to make a cup of coffee, this if for you. If you want to use your own coffee or make more than a cup, you may need to look elsewhere.'),
(9022, 13, 2, 5, '2015-06-29', 'Love my new Keurig 2.0, long thorough review here! This is my 3rd Keurig machine. I\'ve gotten 3+ years life out of my last 2 and I put a lot of coffee through them! When my last one wasn\'t able to be fixed and the warranty had expired, I was excited that I could pick a new one. I immediately loved that the 2.0 was in color! I also was interested in the mini Keurig but decided on this one as I found the mini to be too small and I was able to get a deal with this machine that made it the same price as the mini. I purchased the turquoise and I love the color. It\'s just as bright IRL as it is in the stock photo online. I did notice that the Keurig 2.0 is also just slightly taller than my previous Keurig which works fine with it opening under my cabinet. Setup was very easy and my machine was ready to make coffee quickly! This machine comes with a charcoal filter you install and I brewed a few cups of hot water to clear any reside left from that. This machine also allows you to choose the strength at which you can brew...which I love! I have not tried brewing a carafe pod yet as I am the only coffee drinker in my house and have yet to entertain. I am excited for that option however! Finally, the only tricky part with this machine is that you are only allowed to brew Keurig certified pods in it. You cannot use store brands or the reusable filters with your own coffee. I have found a hack online for that which works if you want to take the time to do that but I\'m happy to use Keurig certified as they taste the best. Don\'t let that worry you, I think there are over 750 different pods available that work and most likely you won\'t have a problem. However, If the reusable filter is your go to, then you won\'t want this machine. Finally, make sure to register your Keurig online as you can get yours replaced within a year if something happens and also some deals on pods. I take my coffee seriously and did a lot of research before purchasing this one. I am very happy with my new machine and the fun color makes my morning routine a little brighter.

The only drawbacks that I notice is that the water reservoir is kind of small and needs to be filled after 3 10oz. cups of coffee and on occasion it doesn\'t make a full cup.

I like being able to do this for one it is way cheaper. SO does Keurig only care about sales and NOT the customer. If they do not change this and make an adapter to let me do this, then I will look for a replacement so I can use my own coffee.

It is a very convenient system we all know that, makes a good cup of coffee and allow you to vary the strength. My frustration with the older model was getting clogged up and slow brewing. My new 2.0 suddenly stopped brewing one day and support walked me through cleaning it with the included cleaning tool. What a difference it was back brewing like the first day. So I need to do this monthly but if that is all I have to do and it keeps on brewing like it does its a small price to pay. So far a much improved model compared to the first one. The screen is easy to use to make your size and strength selection and the big flashing button to brew couldn\'t be easier. Quick and easy clean up and have not run into any issues with odd brands not working. If find some brands are not maybe up to the same standards as others. I like 8 o\'clock Italian Roast but the foil top gets rips and enlarged during use and causes grounds to plug up the works (ergo the cleaning) but since I switched to another brand I don\'t have that problem.

(9042, 13, 2, 1, '2016-05-03', 'poor product So far I have had it replaced x2. The first 2 had the same problem that they heated and dispensed hot water without pushing anything then just turned off, never to run again. 3rd one on the way so hopefully this will work longer than 3 months. we don\'t use it that often, not even daily and keep it turned off since the 1st one heated on its on so not sure if this is a defect or not. Would not buy for myself, was a gift.'),
(9043, 13, 2, 4, '2015-05-30', 'Great Brewer I love this brewer. The touch screen is very intuitive and easy to understand, also, it includes a lot of extra settings like a checkbox for the desired strength of coffee and a hot cocoa setting. The lower tray is removable to accommodate for larger cups. My favorite thing to do is grab a large cup, fill it with ice, and brew an iced coffee k-cup to have a cool, refreshing drink. The only complaint I have is that it is a little bit noisier than the previous Keurig brewer, but it is worth it for the extra features.'),
(9044, 13, 2, 4, '2015-04-20', 'Great! I use this machine almost daily. It is pretty simple to use, except sometimes the water reservoir is tricky. When I first got it I had to fill and refill the reservoir three times before it would register that the tank was full enough to brew a cup of coffee. I also like to drink hot tea and the cup size options for just hot water are not large enough. There is no 10oz option for hot water, which is what I prefer for my tea. So I end up having to brew hot water twice to get enough water. Overall, the machine is nice and basically like any other keurig. I have not, however, purchased the carafe, as it is quite a bit extra.'),
(9045, 13, 2, 2, '2016-04-14', 'Inconsistent Operation I never know if I\'ll actually get a cup of coffee out of my Keurig K-200. Sometimes it works great, recently it\'s very tempremental. I\'ve had it for just over a year, so I would think it should not be failing so soon.'),
(9046, 13, 2, 5, '2015-08-18', 'LOVE I used to buy Starbucks every day which got expensive. My mom bought me my Keurig for nursing school and I have never been happier. It brews super fast and has so many different options. Super easy to use and so worth every penny. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.'),

(9049, 13, 2, 5, '2016-12-27', 'Love it! I purchased this Keurig off of the website, and they delivered it fast! The set up was very easy. I like that a cleaning tool was included to clean the coffee grounds out as well.'),
(9050, 13, 2, 3, '2015-04-14', 'Just wish it was a little hotter! Although I have access to a Keurig at work, this is the first one that I\'ve owned in my home. I enjoy how quick it is to brew a cup of coffee, especially since a full pot would be too much for one person. The display is very easy to use and intuitive. My one complaint is that there isn\'t an option to adjust the beverage temperature. For some reason, the Keurig at my office brews hotter than this model. I personally prefer my beverages on the hotter side. I enjoy the variety of K-cups that are available, but I wish that previous versions were compatible with the 2.0 systems.'),
(9051, 13, 2, 2, '2016-02-07', 'Limited to only Keurig licensed k cups This replaced a Keurig that lasted just over 2 years and had only had bottled water in the tank. Absolutely hate my new one as it won\'t take the K cups that I\'d come to love. All the sample brands are too strong. Would never buy another Keurig knowing they shaft you into buying the more expensive k cups just to use their machine. May as well use my Mr. Coffee that brews by the pot, cost less than $15 and is over 5 years old.'),
(9052, 13, 2, 4, '2015-08-17', 'So Far, So Good! We purchased this new Keurig 2.0 to replace our older model Keurig that was over four years old! We did have some concerns about it and had read very mixed reviews, but our old brewer was on its last leg and needed to be replaced. I wish the water tank was a little larger, but I love the size and compactness of this brewer which is why we chose it over the larger model. Sometimes it seems to take a long time to complete the brew cycle (keeps dripping for what seems like forever!) but overall, we\'re very pleased. Thanks, Kuerig, for the free pods for this review.'),
(9053, 13, 2, 1, '2016-06-19', 'Disappointed Only makes appx 6 cups before needle maintenance is required. NM often takes up to 5 times to perform before regular coffee can be dispensed again. Total waste of money to purchase this Keurig.'),
(9054, 13, 2, 5, '2016-12-19', 'Happy Bought this Keurig in red for my daughter as a Christmas giff! The girl  is ecstatic!! I lobe mine too'),
(9055, 13, 2, 1, '2016-01-11', 'Replaced the first one and it doesn\'t work either. We bought the Keurig 2.0 and were so excited to use it. We got two in one day, both having the same problems. Here\'s our issue: 1. Leaves a lot of coffee grounds in the coffee. I had read that the needle is puncturing the K-cup filter. Poor design. This was the biggest issue because it\'s undrinkable. 2. Sometimes it makes the right amount, but most of the time it\'s way off. We brew 10 ounces and only get 4-6 back. 3. It ONLY uses Keurig brand coffee. Which isn\'t a major problem but a little annoying if we want to try other brands. 4. It brews hot, but not hot enough. Coffee makers are supposed to brew hotter than the consumer can stand to allow for adequate cooling, and allows for adding of refrigerated creamers. So what happens is my coffee now gets cold very fast. Previous Keurig\'s we\'ve owned did not have this problem. 5. We have had it one day and it no longer dispenses coffee. The screen continues to read \"error\" even though we have done everything by the book. Will be returning for a previous model. To add a positive note, I loved the option to make the coffee stronger, and it did exactly that! Disappointed in this model, but looking forward to Keurig hopefully making a better version.'),
(9056, 13, 2, 5, '2016-12-07', 'Love it This is my 2nd Keurig and I love how sophisticated it is. If you don\'t want to use a kcup and just need hot water for your tea it will ask you if you want to dispense hot water only. Awesome! With my other Keurig you had to put a fake kcup in to get just water otherwise the water would splash all over. Also the touch screen is sweet - selecting desired size with your finger and it even asks you if you want your coffee strong. There is also a cocoa option. I have the turquoise color and love it. They had a light mint color in the store that wasn\'t available online that I might\'ve liked better, but it was too much hassle to exchange it on the spot at the store.'),
(9057, 14, 2, 1, '2015-12-13', 'Bad and cheap I bought it online and Since I pick it up the box was cheap. I come home and open it and saw the blender so cheap so I returned it'),
(9058, 13, 2, 5, '2015-08-11', 'Wonderful Viewer I love this Keurig! I used to own a Keurig mini, and while it could get the (limited) job done, it was severely lacking in size diversity, variety of beverages, ease of use, etc (I hated having to add water every time instead of having a reservoir). Before heading back to college this fall I decided to take the plunge and upgrade to the K250. It is everything I hoped for and more. The touch screen is easy to use, the reservoir is way sleeker than older models (My parents own the original Keurig), and the variety of beverages and sizes (from ~4oz to a whole carafe) is lovely. I\'ll definitely enjoy using this for a long time to come. It\'ll make my hectic college mornings easier to navigate since I\'ll have my own cup of coffee before even leaving my dorm! Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.'),
(9059, 13, 2, 4, '2015-05-13', 'Love This Machine! I love that this allows me to make different drinks for the members of our home as well as the option of a whole carafe (sold separately though I wish I was included - main con). My son and I both enjoy the fact that he can quickly and safely make his own hot cocoa.'),

(9061, 13, 2, 4, '2015-07-31', 'Review I always used to think that keurig\'s were overrated and that they just did the same thing a regular coffee pot, guess I just didn\'t see the appeal. Then I got one for a gift and fell in love! It is great for the weekends when I want a fancy flavor and don\'t want a whole pot. Would definitely recommend this to friends in the future. Thanks, keurig, for the free pods for this review.'),

(9063, 13, 2, 5, '2015-04-21', 'Quick and Easy I have never been much of a coffee drinker mainly because I didn\'t care to make a full pot of coffee in a traditional coffee maker. I have never had a Keurig before so I can\'t compare it to other models but I love this machine. I drink 90% more coffee now because of how easy and quick it is to make a cup whenever I want. I wasn\'t sure what to expect when I started to brew my first cup but I was so impressed. It was easy to set up for the first time and I love the way it looks. It is a good size and looks nice sitting on my kitchen counter. One complaint I have heard is that it would be better if you could use the reusable cup like in other Keurig models. I can imagine that would be helpful for people who drink a lot of coffee as the K-cups can get expensive. I, on the other hand do not drink enough coffee for it to be that big of a problem. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants an occasional cup of coffee.'),
(9064, 13, 2, 5, '2017-01-01', 'I Love it!!! I am a first time Keurig owner and I have to say I\'m loving every moment of it. Life is just more fun and easier when you have a keurig. My most absolute favorite thing is that it comes in my favorite color even better. If you don\'t own one get one.'),
(9065, 13, 2, 5, '2015-07-20', 'Perfect for College Thanks Keurig for the free pods for this review! I really like that this comes in bright colors and that it has a water reservoir! This is a great brewer for the casual-everyday coffee drinker.'),
(9066, 13, 2, 5, '2015-04-10', 'Excellent Brewer! I loved this new brewer. I use it at least twice in the morning (everyday), and more throughout the day on the weekends. I am impressed with the variety of cup sizes it brews, and the reservoir is big enough that I\'m not constantly refilling it. I also really love the slimmer design of the K200. It looks and fits wonderfully on my counter top!'),
(9067, 13, 2, 5, '2016-10-23', 'Oasis is beautiful!! I loved this machine so much that I bought another one so I could have it at work and at home. The Oasis color is gorgeous, and I just realized that it\'s a special edition only sold at Target. Despite the electronic system being very particular about how much water in the machine or it won\'t work, it\'s very easy and fun to use. I appreciate the charcoal water filter because clean water makes coffee taste better. Definitely get this!'),
(9068, 13, 2, 5, '2015-07-07', 'Keurig has done it again! My Keurig 2.0 works like a charm. Love the color (orange)! This is a great addition to my home. When setting up my Keurig I had a few questions and those questions were easily answered by the friendly representatives of Keurig. Now we are rolling with a cup or 2 each morning! Thanks Keurig for the free pods for this review.'),
(9069, 13, 2, 4, '2015-06-29', 'Love My New Brewer I\'ve had previous Keurig Brewers and this by far is the best, love that I can chose strength, size and brew a pot of coffee if I chose. Down side is I can\'t brew my Tim Hortons kcups since they are not a recognized brand.'),
(9070, 14, 2, 1, '2014-12-31', 'Used it 2 times and motor blew I purchased it on sale. Motor blew when used second time. Worst blender ever purchased!!'),
(9071, 13, 2, 5, '2015-07-08', 'This is fantastic I love that I can brew one cup or a pot. Every cup is fresh and you never have to worry if you left the coffee pot on. On the weekends we have a booth at a farmer\'s market and I brew a pot. I got it in the Orange and I love the color.'),
(9072, 13, 2, 5, '2015-09-19', 'Great Brewer for the price! We bought this on vacation and towed it home, having been at an isolated ski resort with very few services. We have owned the Keurig Mini but it was getting up there in uses. So my hubby took the mini to work and we use this new model at home. I wouldn\'t hesitate to buy it again!'),
(9073, 13, 2, 2, '2015-09-16', 'Liked the Original Keurig Better We had the original Keurig and loved it until it finally died. We purchased the 2.0 and have been so disappointed. It feels like we\'ve regressed instead of making it better. It\'s slower, takes forever to make a cup of coffee, then you only get 10 ounces! There\'s often grounds in the bottom of the cup. Overall, I\'m just bummed that I don\'t have my old Keurig.'),
(9074, 13, 2, 4, '2015-08-19', 'Great System The hubby and I use this machine every day, and even more so on the weekends. Great, fresh cup of Joe, but I do wish we would\'ve purchased the level above this one as we underestimated our size and frequency use. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review! You all are the best :)'),
(9075, 13, 2, 5, '2015-06-29', 'Compact, Stylish, Easy to Use I was using a regular coffee brewing machine for my morning rush to work. However, the Keurig 250 is so fast, I use it work mornings and save the fresh ground coffee for the weekend. Excellent product. \"Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review\"'),
(9076, 13, 2, 4, '2016-12-05', 'Yep It\'s a Keurig. It makes coffee. That\'s what it said it would do, and that\'s what it does. Employees are happy we bought the machines for them ... I just hope it does\'t slow down productivity. (Ha.)   Nice product. Semi-compact.  Nice features. Easy to use.'),
(9077, 13, 2, 5, '2015-09-01', 'I would definitely buy this brewer again This brewer is good for being able to have different drinks throughout the day, especially as a college student. I also like all of the stylish color options that are available. Having the different beverage sizes is a nice bonus as well. I just wish it was a little less noisy when dispensing the drink. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.'),
(9078, 13, 2, 5, '2015-08-07', 'Love my Keurig 2.0! My husband got me the Keurig 2.0 for my birthday this year and it has changed everything! It is even better than my espresso machine, which I now plan on selling! I love how easy it is to make one cup for me, or a carafe for the family when they come over. It\'s so quiet too that I don\'t wake up my son in the morning like I did with the espresso machine. I also love how easy it is to clean it. I can\'t get enough of my Keurig! Thanks Keurig, for the free pods for this review.'),

(9081, 13, 2, 2, '2016-01-13', 'NEEDS SOME IMPROVEMENTS Keeps asking for water after one cup brewed. Water is not hot enough in brewing coffee. Seems a bit loud. Nice colors and size for kitchens.'),
(9082, 13, 2, 5, '2015-08-10', 'Perfect size for an apartment I purchased this brewer because it\'s a smaller version but still has all the features of the bigger models. I also loved the fact that it comes in different color options...I bought the strawberry color. It really pops in the kitchen. I am usually running out the door every mirning, and this machine is so quick to heat water and brew that it works perfectly with my lack of time. I would highly recommend this to anyone. I don\'t drink coffee, but the tea comes out tasting great!!!'),
(9083, 13, 2, 5, '2016-12-31', 'Love it! I like Keurigs and when our original K50 finally kicked them bucket after 6 years it was time to get new. K50 is basic and simple. My office has a K425 and I think it\'s a little much since there\'s only two coffee drinkers in the house. I love the strong coffe feature so I chose the K200. My husband is in love with the strong feature and we bought one for his mother for Christmas. She loves the baby blue color and the strong feature as well.'),
(9084, 13, 2, 5, '2015-04-21', 'Simple and easy I absolutely LOVE my new Keurig 2.0! It is super easy to use. I love the digital look and that you can choose from multiple oz. settings. I didn\'t drink coffee every day because I hated wasting coffee in a big pot. Now my family can quickly brew a cup anytime of day and nothing goes to waste!'),
(9085, 13, 2, 4, '2016-02-06', 'so far so good we noticed the unit is always warm, but could not find anything in the manual or website about a \"warm\" mode. Is this proper? Please explain this feature, and how to over-ride it if possible. An On-Off switch would be nice.'),

That is exactly what the Keurig 2.0 delivers! Exceptional tasting coffee and at an affordable price. My wife and I purchased this unit about two weeks ago and simply love it. The ease of use and the range of available flavors makes this a coffee lover\'s dream come true! Plus, not only can we brew a single cup, but we can also brew an entire carafe for guests with the accessory purchased. I want to personally thank Keurig for the free pods for this review. So, what are you waiting for? Get out there and purchase one today and start loving the brew.'),

(9089, 13, 2, 2, '2016-01-30', 'This is a so so item I got this for Christmas, gave my old Keurig to my son and wish I would have kept it. My old Keurig would use with any K-Cup no matter who the manufacturer was. I now receive a message with my 2.0 saying my k-cup not compatible. I\'ve received the message that the needle is clogged and the machine is a month old. I would not recommend this to a friend. My daughter received the coffee ninja for Christmas and loves it, wish i would have asked for that.'),
(9090, 13, 2, 4, '2017-01-12', 'Help I bought this 3 mos. ago and we\'re very pleased with this product. I need help finding a replacement water filter cartridge for this unit. The replacement I ordered was too tall.'),
(9091, 13, 2, 5, '2015-07-05', 'Size doesn\'t always matter. I recently purchased this brewer to replace my Mini Keurig and VUE Brewers. The size is great (like the mini( it fits perfectly on my counter. Unlike the Mini it holds 40 ounces of water which makes it far more convenient. Unlike the VUE, it brews the more popular K-Cup pods, and it will brew a pot of coffee. I really enjoy this brewer. Thanks Keurig.'),
(9092, 13, 2, 2, '2015-08-31', 'Not happy. I use this every morning, and some afternoons. I do enjoy my coffee, but disappointed that the 10 oz size doesn\'t fill the cup. Wish it had a larger size. Coffee is not has hot as the previous Keurig I had. I purchased one before for my granddaughter for college and liked the looks, so this is why I got this one.'),

(9099, 13, 2, 4, '2015-05-09', 'Coffee never smelled so good! I am so thankful I received this product to test for free from Influenster. I have used Keurig products before but I only used the mini version or an older version my work had. I really like the amount of cup sizes you can brew. I was also pleased that I could fit just about every size of mug under the brewer. Once the water was heated, it brewed coffee very quickly. The only issues I really had with the brewer was you are limited to Keurig K-cups. While there are a lot out there, that definitely limits the cups you can use. Also, while you can brew a carafe, you have to buy it separately. Overall, I am very pleased with the new 2.0 k250 brewer!'),
(9100, 13, 2, 2, '2016-01-05', 'Disappointed I purchased this for my boyfriend for christmas. I\'ve used my mom\'s keurig (another older model) and loved it. She used her own coffee rather than the pods and it always tasted perfect. I purchased the my kcup and carafe to go along with the brewer. Unfortunately no matter what I\'ve tried I can\'t manage to get a strong cup of coffee out of the my kcup. I can\'t speak for the regular pods as we haven\'t used these and never intended to. Is there a trick I don\'t know about? I\'ve searched the internet and discovered many other people have had the same issue. It\'s a real bummer and I guess I\'m just going to have to give in and buy regular pods. Its a shame. I really want to have the freedom to use whatever coffee I want. My sister got us some specialty coffee from a roaster in dallas and I can\'t even get a proper brew from it. It literally looks like tea no matter what I do. I\'ve adjusted the grind and made sure not to over pack the filter. Nothing works. Just be warned if you were thinking of using this for your own coffee. You will be very disappointed.'),

I love the stylish look and design, the resevoir, the fast brewing time, and the availability of really customizing your coffee/beverage! The touch screen is great. And there seeems to be a wide variety of pods available for use with the Keurig� 2.0 K250 Brewing System. I have already ordered the caraffee and three kinds of pods to use with it. The only concern I have is that its inability to brew other pods (aka non-Keurig) will limit the consumer and reduce the desire to purchase something that only uses its brand. (Think VCR vs BetaMax, and Tassimo.) I would like to have a caraffe that holds more, but for such a quick brew system I am satisfied. Other than that, I am in love with this machine!'),

I thought it would be great because it had so many features and brew sizes.   What it failed to mention was that you need special carafe sized k-cups to access everything except up to a 10 oz brew and you can only use Keurig registered cups.

THE NEW UNIT (2.0) WILL ONLY WORK W/ KEURIG K-CUPS AND KEURIG DOES NOT MAKE A REFILLABLE K-CUP FOR THE 2.0 SYSTEM AT THIS TIME. I RESOVED ALL PROBLEMS BY PEELING OFF A FRESHLEY BREWED KEURIG K-CUP TOP ( THE HEAT RELEASED THE GLUE ON THE CUP TOP) AND PLACED IT PRINTED SIDE UP ON PAKING TAPE (STICKY SIDE UP) THEN TAPED THAT TAPE WITH PRINTED SIDE UP TO MY REFILLABLE TOP. I THEN INSERTED THE REFILLABLE K-CUP IN THE THE 2.0 UNIT, CLOSED THE TOP, THEN OPENED THE UNIT AND PRESSED THE EXPOSED TAPE ON TO THE EXPOSED BOTTOM OF LID (CLOSING MECHINISM). IT WOKED FINE BUT DID NOT HAVE THE FULL MENU.!!!! TO FIX THAT, I USED A SMALL 1/32 SCALE SLOT CAR MAGNET AND PLACED IT ON THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE K-CUP INSERT HOLDER. IT HOLDS MAGNETICALLY IN A VERTICLE POSITION AUTOMACTICALLY. VIOLA!!!!!! I NOW HAVE FULL MENU AND CARAFE CAPABILITY AND AM USING MY AFTER MARKET REFILLABLE K-CUP!!! SHAME ON YOU KEURIG!!!!!!!! FOR GETTING GREEDY ABOUT YOUR COFFEE SALES!!! TO RE-DESIGN A QUALITY COFFEE MAKER THAT WILL NOT ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO USE THE COFFEE OF HIS CHOICE IS UNCONSCIENABLE AND DOWN RIGHT WRONG!!!!

The size of this machine is just right. It doesn\'t take up too much counter space, but still holds a decent amount of water and accommodates most cup sizes. The violet color is very fun and bright. The \"strong\" setting on the brewer is a very nice feature and does seem to help provide a more flavorful cup of coffee. The only thing I wish this particular model had was an Auto Off feature. But I will gladly sacrifice that feature for the more compact size (and the violet color). Overall, very satisfied with my purchase. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.'),

And I love that I can make a 10oz mug, some single serve machines only make a 6oz cup! But mornings when both of us want coffee, I can make a whole carafe, which is very nice.

Here is a list of the pros (and very few cons) of the Keurig 2.0: Pros: Screen that tells you what is going on. This is AWESOME for someone who is impatient and skeptical, like me. If it weren\'t for the screen on the new Keurig 2.0 telling me that it was preheating, I might go into a panic, wondering if I did something wrong. And it is is touch screen. This is awesome. Water amount options. Via the touch screen you can select four (I think the old Keurig machines only had 3) different pour options: 4 oz (for super-strong), 6 oz, 8 oz, 10 oz. I, a coffee fiend, went for the strong-ish 6 oz pour. Add hot water option. Turns out that the 6 oz pour did not fill my mug enough, so I was was pleased that there was an option to add just hot water to your cup. Even after adding hot water my cup of coffee was still really good and strong. I was honestly impressed with the Keurig coffee. Descaling solution. The machine came with descaling solution, which is great because if you want your coffee machine to last, you need to descale it often. A bunch of free pods. The Keurig 2.0 came with a bunch (I think ~30) free pods in all different varieties. Very generous of them! My husband even tried the tea and liked it. Very sleek and compact. This machine looks great on the counter in our small, seminary-housing apartment. It fit in the place I usually keep my blender (which means it is very compact). It fit well below our cabinets, as well. Instruction manual in multiple languages and has lots of good info. Including giving you information about recycling K-cups. And...perhaps my favorite: it is polite. This Keurig is noticeably polite! It says \"Welcome\", \"Please\", \"Enjoy\"... etc. Very polite programing, thank you very much. Less dishes. At the end of the day, all you have to clean is your mug. Cons: No Carafe. I was excited about the coffee pot feature of the Keurig 2.0, which will be great when we have guests over. However the Carafe is sold separately, which kind of disappointed me. Froze. Because it is now run by a more complicated computer (because of the touch screen, etc.) this means there is more room for bugs. My machine got caught in a loop and was stuck \"preheating\" for about 10 minutes before I realized it was not really preheating. At that point I unplugged the machine to give it a restart. When I plugged it back in it started reheating right away. So, as you can see, there are very few cons and lots of pros! I will consider giving this as a gift for some upcoming weddings! The product is great.'),

(9146, 13, 2, 5, '2015-10-30', 'Perfect coffee for all lifestyles! I first fell in love with Keurig machines at an old job where a coworker had a machine. It was great because I had a night shift and could get the perfect fix of caffeine when all the shops were closed. When she left and took her Keurig with her I was devastated. The lack of coffee at my fingertips frightened me. Luckily I have since convinced my roommates to purchase the K200 brewing system and life couldn\'t be better. First off I have to say Keurig themselves are a pretty awesome group. I was using a coupon to purchase this brewer but the color I wanted to purchase was sold out. I emailed support to ask if there was any chance that color might be back in stock before the coupon ran out. Although the dates didn\'t quite work out their customer support responded quickly and was super friendly. They even gave me a coupon for a free box of pods because I was sad about the color being sold out. Speaking of colors, can I just say how awesome it they have such a variety of colors available! I love pops of color and have always been a little bored by the monotone colors available for basic kitchen appliances. It was super exciting to have the option to choose between so many fun and attractive color choices. But enough about it\'s appearance, how does this thing work? Super easily! I\'m no master chef and often get stressed out thinking about making things in the kitchen. Coffee is one of those things that everyone has very specific requirements about how they want them to taste, and if you don\'t get it right they\'re doubly cranky because they lack caffeine. This machine is amazing because everyone can customize the size and strength of their cup of joe. I haven\'t used it yet but you can brew a carafe for a larger party, or if you really just need all the coffee ever. I love this thing because although I don\'t work as late as I once did, I\'m still on an opposite schedule than my roommates. With a larger coffee pot I would either be faced with drinking old, cold coffee or trying to figure out the science and ratio of water to coffee to brew a smaller batch in those big jugs. It never ended well for me with mostly watery coffee. Now when I roll out of bed mid morning I get the perfect amount of fresh hot coffee with minimal effort. I should also mention I am incredibly lazy which makes this machine a god send, no measurements or leaving machine warmers on for hours or daily clean ups of a pot. The ease of popping a cup in and pressing 3 buttons makes my mornings that much happier. Also no fear of leaving the warmer on and potentially burning down your house is a plus. We once had to turn around in a snow storm to go turn off our old coffee maker. Cleanup with this machine is a breeze! About once a week I wipe down the sides of the machine since coffee sometimes splashes up, and give a good wash to the drip tray. The water tank is pretty small and easily monitored for any potential buildup that would need to be washed out. We use this machine so often I doubt anything has time to build up! The only slight negative I have, is I am a little weary to brew things like iced tea through this in fears of it somehow tasting like coffee. I know the easy fix is to run a cycle or 2 of hot water to get rid of any remaining odors, but as I mentioned before I am lazy and not desperate to have quick iced tea at my finger tips. In my mind Keurig can do no wrong! And although Keurig is compensating me with some k cups for writing this I would gladly tell anyone within earshot about the wonders of this machine! So small it can easily fit anywhere in your kitchen! Fun colors and the fastest coffee in all the land. You will not regret one second of your purchase and might kick yourself for not getting one sooner. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.'),

We have the 2.0, and love all of the new features! Pros: Quiet���so much quieter than the first version. Lots more options when brewing. You can opt for a \"strong\" brew, change the amount of water used, or (my favorite) just heat water! Love that feature for brewing tea. This version has a carafe that you can fill with using special pods. I\'d love to try this out for brewing a large quantity of coffee, but it was not included with my package. I love that you can descale your machine. We had the original version of the Keurig and this was not something that was mentioned/recommended (if I remember right). Such a great way to keep your machine running great. Cons: The water chamber signals needing to be refilled when it still has 1/3 of the water left in it. At our house, my husband and I drink multiple cups of coffee each day, so it needs to be refilled frequently. The coffee is not equal to a strong cup you\'d get from an espresso machine (which is what we used to make coffee prior to getting this Keurig.) But, if you like coffee, don\'t need a crazy strong brew (even using the strong feature), this machine is quiet, easy to clean, and easy peasy to use.

However, this new system clogs constantly (like, on the 3rd use!). I finally figured out that if I used the Rogers cups (the ones with paper bottoms instead of plastic), it no longer clogged...and tasted better!

But the biggest reason that I am returning this machine without giving it to my husband is the restriction on which coffee pods can be used in the machine. We like to use Dunkin coffee, among others. Though this restriction on Keurig\'s part is a classic capitalist move, it just seems downright unAmerican. It\'s laughable to see Keurig respond to complaints about this limitation with the comment, \"We\'re sorry to hear you have k-cup pods that will not brew in your new 2.0 K250. \" They\'re sorry to hear it? It\'s exactly what they wanted. They designed it that way. Sorry, but I just can\'t support that kind of corporate malfeasance.'),

I only drink one small cup of coffee a day, so this is perfect for me, but I intend to get the carafe so that I can use it when I have company over. I notice a lot of people complaining that not all K-Cups work in the 2.0, and that\'s true- I got some Crazy Cups in my variety pack that don\'t work, so I just open them, dump the grounds into the reusable cup and brew. Throw away the top, and recycle the cup (since Crazy Cups are recyclable). Additionally, if someone wants more coffee, there\'s always the option to brew a carafe!

We have an original Kuerig at home that gets much more use and it never clogs, and always brews the perfect cup of coffee. This 2.0 is like a bad movie sequel. Worst mistake I ever made with coffee Brewers. I will say that customer service is always very helpful. But who wants a product that always needs maintenance?

I immediately said \"No, just send me the cheaper one, the K2.0 200, because I know this one has a good track record.\" This model works the best! Believe me!!!

So I took it back and got a new one giving them another chance same model and everything, it worked great for about two weeks and then just stopped working again!

It seemed an expensive way to brew coffee, but if one looks at the major coffee shops, this is a a lot more cost efficient per cup. In the last 6 months not only have I purchased the 2.0 which is compact which is what I was looking for, but also the Rivo unit. The 2.0 makes a very good cup of coffee in multiple sizes, as well as tea, and hot cocoa. The ease of use makes it very accessible for each of my family members! \"Thanks, Keurig , for the free pods for this review.\"'),

When I received my Keurig 2.0 from Influenster to review, I was elated. It is so convenient to brew one cup at a time. I was used to using a conventional brewer and always guessing just how much water to put in for my one lonely cup, now my Keurig does the measuring for me. And if I decide I need a second cup to cure my afternoon crash, it\'s not a problem. I only wish my travel mug fit under so I could brew and run out to enjoy my coffee in the car loop. I also love that it despenses hot water for an evening cup of tea or to make the kids hot cocoa. One thing missing is an auto shut off. It would be nice if it turned it self off after a certain amount of time.'),

My Keurig K250 is very easy to use and doesn\'t take up a lot of room on my counter.  The only drawback is I\'m unable to use my re-useable cups with this machine.

I love the Keurig brand, but I love my coffee more. And this new 2.0 is not compatible with my reusable filter ! So i had to disconnect the new 2.0 and put in my old Keurig Elite B45 Brewer which accepts all types of reusable filters. I am on a fixed income and cannot afford to buy a specific filter or buy the Keurig brand K-cups. so most likely I will return this 2.0 ! As I stated before I love my coffee more than a machine to make it !!! Yes I like the touch screen and yes I like the compact design. I also like the fact that I can add a carafe as well and I am upset that I will not be able to enjoy these amenities ! I was really excited and was brimming with anticipation to use this Keurig 2.0 K200 ! And now with one issue(reusable filter),my hopes were shattered, and my morning ruined ! Thanks Keurig !'),

I\'ve had this coffeemaker for a few months and the coffee tastes like plastic. I have done everything they said to do to get rid of it, but it is still there.   It doesn\'t get the coffee hot enough.   You have to use the new kcups with DRM technology or try one of the hacks you can find online. A few times it has left coffe grounds in the bottom of my cup.'),

Not only am I beyond frustrated, I purchased the machine only to get it home and found that it had been previously purchased and used (and broke and returned the store with a used K cup still in it GROSS) I then came back home and unpacked a new machine and had problems with that one, and called Kurig customer service only to be treated rudely. This machine does not read the top of the K cups nor does the outside of the packaging indicate that you CAN\'T use your old K cups with it. So folks if you don\'t have the right K cups - beware, you will have to go out and purchase the right ones to use with this machine. Then, hold your breath that the machine will hold the water and it won\'t leak all over the place. Horrible experience with this thing!!!'),

I finally did it last October. WoW...am I ever glad I dd. I use it for hot coffee drinks, iced tea (brewed with hot water), cocoa, soups, instant hot cereals. I have just ordered another one to put into my RV when we set it up as a home away from home. It is WoNdErFuL!!! The only thing that is bother is that I run my water through a Britta before putting it into the Keurig. Probably overdoing it...but I haven\'t had any problems for 4 months of constant use.'),

I do wish the temperature was hotter but I know that\'s a safety issue. I recommend shoppers make sure of the distance between countertop and bottom of upper cabinets.

I love this new option! However you will need to buy the carafe and different size kcup OR the reusable carafe size coffee filter. The color is awesome and looks really neat in my kitchen. The only thing I have noticed different is that you must use KEURIG brand k cups because it detects the lid in order to brew it perfectly (hot chocolate differs from coffee for example). When I looked at my stash of Keurig kcups I realized everyone I own is Keurig brand anyway, so it was not a deal breaker for me. Keurig has TONS of brands associated with them.'),

My current model, the Cuisinart SS-700, is quite a few years old, and I was growing tired of having a separate coffee pot for when we have company. I thought this would be the answer to my prayers!  WRONG. This version is so loud. At first I thought maybe I had received a bad model so I watched some YouTube videos and heard the same noise. The pump sounds like it\'s taking in water in glugs, and having a hard time doing it. Nothing like either of my old Keurigs. This particular model isn\'t programable, so if you liked/wanted that feature, you would need to upgrade to one of the two higher models.  I will say that this model is slimmer in width than the older models which is still a plus. And if you can get past the noise, it would give the opportunity to make a carafe or a single serving.  I am glad I only ran water through it a few times because this is going back to the store tomorrow.'),

You can make an individual cup or if you buy the carafe(you can make enough for the group) I love the versatility of all the flavors as well!
